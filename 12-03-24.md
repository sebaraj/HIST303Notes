# Lecture 23 - December 3, 2024 - The Russo-Japanese War

### Lecture Outline

#### 1. **Treaty Revision**

- Another indicator of Japan’s rising fortunes
- Challenge of the Triple Intervention
  - involved Russia, Germany, and France saying that they did not like Japan having major control
    over Asia, and force Japan to hand back some of their territorial gains that they won from war
    (the Liaodong Peninsula)
  - but just as the gave it up, the Russians took over the peninsula and the Germans, now pretty
    keen to catch up to their European allies, claimed the Shandong Peninsula
  - very annoying to people in Japan, but the implications were greater than just national pride;
    the strategic implications were significant; now Japan's influence over Korea was very unsure;
  - Japan now had two major European powers right on its doorstep
  - rather than easing their position in the world, the years after the Sino-Japanese war led to a
    wretching up of foreign anxiety
- The Kabo (or Gabo) Reforms
  - Korean reformers (who were often sympathetic to Japan) felt a sense of urgency of the foreign
    powers around the Korean borders
  - tried to modernize Korea at a much faster rate, and tried to dismantle Korea overnight
  - but after the Triple intervention, Korea looked very weak and vulnerable, so the reformers were
    pushed back by the conservative faction (Korean King Kojong and Queen Min)
    - some military leaders decide to take matters into their own hands, and decide to take the
      queen hostage and execute her
  - But polarized Korea even more, and is still a contentious issue in Korean-Japanese relations
  - assassination leads to the kind to seek refuge in the Russian Legation

#### 2. **New Rivalries in Korea and Manchuria**

- Korean Resistance to Japan after the Sino-Japanese War
  - Russia’s Growing Influence
  - King Kojong and the Russian Legation
    - flees to the Russian embassy in Seoul with russian backing
  - Japanese decide to just negotiate directly with the Russians over Korea
  - Trans-Siberian Railway
  - Czar Nicholas II decides to build a railway from Moscow to Vladivostok, to link Europe and
    Siberia/Asia
    - Japanese see this as a direct threat to their interests in Korea
- Japan’s Response
  - Ito was prime minister, and his plan was to negotiate with the Russians and exchange Manchuria
    for Korea
  - The Boxer Rebellion
    - group of anti-foreign Chinese, who were against the foreign powers in China, rise up and kill
      many foreigners in China
    - attacks that they lead were publized throughout the west and Japan sides with the west,
      playing a significant role in quelling the uprising and coming to the rescue of white europeans
    - Russia takes advantage of this momement to move more troops into Manchuria
      - after the rebellion is over, Russia does not withdraw their troops
      - also reject the request to exchange Manchuria for Korea
  - Yamagata: Anglo-Japanese Alliance (1902) and Militarization
    - Yamagata was a military leader, and he was very much against the idea of negotiating with the
      Russians
    - form a stronger alliance with the British (who were the primary Russian rival at the time)
    - also wanted to further strengthen the military
    - by 1897, 59% of the national budget was going to the military (creating additional elements in
      the army and building up the navy)
    - In 1903, Japanese leadership was not confident that they had a chance to defeat the Russians;
      decide to buy themselves more time and open up another round of negotiations with the
      Russians, trying to get them to remove their troops from Manchuria
    - But by 1904, they recognized that the Russians were not going to budge and the only way to end
      Russian influence in the area was through military action

#### 3. **The Russo-Japanese War, 1904-5**

- Surprise attack on Port Arthur
  - in February 1904, Japanese launch a surprise attack on the Russian fleet in Port Arthur
  - hailed around the world, especially in the english speaking countries, as a brilliant military
    move
  - soon after, troops are langded on the liaodong peninsula and take over Dalian
  - then launch a full scale invasion of Port Arthur
    - lost 60,000 Japanese
- The Battles of Mukden and Tsushima
  - Mukden was the largest land battle in history at the time
    - after 10 days of bitter fighting, the Japanese took contorl of the city
    - 70,000 Japanese casualties, 90,000 Russian casualties, and many more Russian soldiers taken
      prisoner
  - Japan was running out of resources, while Russia was able to replenish their troops
  - after the battle of Mukden, the supreme commander of the army in Manchuria urged Yamagata to sue
    for peace
  - soon after, the Japanese win a decisive naval battle at Tsushima
    - destroy the entire Russian baltic fleet
- Japans approach the Americans as an ally
- Russians were also weary of the domestic unrest back home (first russian revolution)
- Portsmouth Treaty
  - mediated by Teddy Roosevelt
  - Japan gets the Liaodong Peninsula, the southern half of Sakhalin, and the South Manchuria Railway
  - Japan also gets a large indemnity
  - Japan is now seen as a major power in the world
  - Russia is humiliated, and the Czar is forced to make concessions to the Duma

#### 4. **Consequences of the War**

- rising nationalism in Japan about what it achieved on the battlefield
- The Hibiya Riots and "Imperial Democracy"

  - but after learning about the terms of the treaty and that Japan had run out of money from the
    war, the people riot
    - leads to the destruction of 350+ buildings, mass arrests, and over 1000 casualties, including
      many police officers
    - leads to marshall law being declared in Tokyo
    - Meiji leaders were getting scared of popular uprisings
  - think of the Hibiya Riots as "imperial democracy" (a mix of a manisfestation of the popular
    appetite for imperialist expansion and a precursor to democratization)

- ultimately helped solidify the pride of the Japanese people in their country
  - army day and navy day celebrations
- International Consequences
  - Tsarist Russia further destabilized
  - Modern trench warfare—premonition to World War I
  - W.E.B. Du Bois, _"The Color Line Belts the World"_ (1906)

## Reactions to the Russo-Japanese War

### The London Times, September 6, 1905

"From the time when the 'Father of History' [Herodotus] wrote of the repulse of the Persians by the
Greeks until now, the relations of East and West have followed, on the whole, a uniform course...
[But] in the last nineteen months that course has been for the first time reversed. A nation of
unmixed Asiatic blood has inflicted defeat after defeat, by sea and by land, on one of the most
powerful military Monarchies of Europe, and has forced it, at sword's point, to renounce, at least
for years to come, the career of conquest which it has proclaimed to be its historic mission."

### W.E.B. Du Bois, _"The Color Line Belts the World"_, Collier's Weekly, October 20, 1906

"For the first time in a thousand years a great white nation has measured arms with a colored nation
and been found wanting. The Russo-Japanese War has marked an epoch. The magic of the word 'white' is
already broken, and the Color Line in civilization has been crossed in modern times as it was in the
past. The awakening of the yellow races is certain. That the awakening of the brown and black races
will follow in time, no unprejudiced student of history can doubt. Shall the awakening of these
sleepy millions be in accordance with, and aided by, the great ideals of white civilization, or in
spite of them and against them? This is the problem of the Color Line."
