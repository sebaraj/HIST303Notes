# Lecture 12 - October 8, 2024 - Dismantling Feudalism

## Lecture Outline

### 1. What is feudalism?

- Alive and well in the Japanese context, but there are different ways to think about it/Japan in
  this period
- Some possible definitions
  - Marxian definition
    - Samurai (military class that governs that uses violence or the threat of violence to control
      the peasants and take extra food) v. peasants (that is growing food)
    - different relationships between different social classes and the ways/means of productions
  - Cultural definition
    - feudalism in terms of social relationships and the form that they take
    - defined by idea of vassalage
    - a samurai and his vassal(s), where the vassal has pledge loyalty/his life to the samurai in
      exhcnage for sustenance
    - also defined many inter-samurai relationships, e.g. between a samurai and his lord/daimyo
    - idea that all people are created equal is not central to this period, rather, everybody has
      their own role to play and someone needs to tell other people what to do
  - Political definition (_gunken_ v. _hōken_)
    - fragmented and uneven authority
    - feudalism in terms of the relatonships between the different lords
    - feudal society is one where the power/authority is decentralized, where is rule
      (semi-)independently
    - by this definition, Japan was most feudal during the warring states period
    - 3 greate unifies united Japan into "stable" kingdom, where even then, there are many, many
      territories
    - some historians use the term "centralized feudalism" to describe the Tokugawa period, but this
      is a contradiction in terms
    - In the east asian political/philosophical tradition, there is a divide between _gunken_ and
      _hoken_ (centralized v. decentralized rule)
    - western scholars chose _hoken_ to describe Japanese feudal society
    - picking which tradition was better was a primary focus in the early years of the Meiji
      restoration
    - That is why the ancient council of state (daijo-kan) and other ancient institutions were
      revived
    - backed by the idea tha the emperor should be in change of everything
    - issue was that some of the new leaders still had loyalty to their home domains, and were slow
      to essentially take away their domains' power

### 2.. Abolition of the Domains

- State Structures and the ‘Restoration of Imperial Rule’
- In 1868, all the daimyo pledge loyalty to the emperor
- But in 1869, the daimyo of the southwestern domains spontaneously volunteer to give up their
  domains back to the ownership of the emperor (as a sign of loyalty). but at this point, just a show,
  because the daimyos are told to "govern" those domains as they had before
- In August 1869, doesnt seem like much will change. but over the next year, the government is faced
  with pressure to do something about the domains
- Yamagata Aritomo (1838-1922) is the first to propose the abolition of the domains
  - samurai from Choshu (born into the lowest ranks) but helps spearhead the militia groups that
    recruit from all members of society
  - one of 100 other men from across the country to serve as "court appointees" (_Choshi_), a
    proto-parliament
  - had very little reason to support the status-quo, as they had not been brought into
    priviledge
  - as they spent more time working for the regime, their loyalty shifted from their home domains
    to the emperor, i.e. the imperial cause is the national cause
  - suggestion for the complete abolition of the old domains comes from here
- The financial difficulties of the domains
  - public expenditures were increasing, but the domains were not able to increase their income and
    thus could not modernized their militaries
  - domains then begged the emperor/the central regime
    - government would continue paying the daimyo and samurai retainers were promised a stipend
  - e.g. domain of Yoshi
  - some domains were too proud to do this, so they went to other domains to ask to be absorbed
- The credibility of the new government
  - Kido and Okubo recognized that the new government was likely to be seen as an extention of the
    choshu and satsuma domains
  - to address this, they needed to show that the new government was not just a continuation of the
    old regime
  - in 1871, the proposal of the lower ranking court appointees was accepted and the domains were
    abolished
- From domains to prefectures (1871)
  - 302 prefectures were created to take over the 300+ domains, but over the next few years are
    gradually reduced to 43
  - growing sense of national consciousness and men working across political boundaries that existed
    previously was important
  - The spread of elected assemblies
    - Meiji government focused on making sure the new prefectural governments, who were originally
      run by the previous daimyo, were relatively small
      (reduce cost + increase efficiency)
    - gradually replaced by professional bureaucrats, appointed by the central government, and
      daimyo were invited + given formal titles
    - small size of prefectual governments mean that the central government must look elsewhere for
      ideas to govern
      - pulled from non-samurai, non-daimyo, non-court nobles
      - but they started to get upset that they were not represented/included in the government
- by 1875, there are already 7 new prefectures with elected officials + even more with a combination
  of elected and appointed officials
- Okubo originally wanted to encourange the elections of local prefectural officials, but not b/c he
  wanted to give people a voice, but in order to "keep the local officials busy so the central
  government can rule" and to also have a scapegoat for discontent
- Samurai were retitled as gentry, continue to receive smaller stipends and enjoy legal priviledges
  - but by beginning of Meiji restoration, it was clear that the samurai were not going to be the
    ones really fighting, as military might could not be built on the basis of heriditary priviledge

### 3. Introduction of Conscription

- Yamagata Aritomo was a strong advocate of western-style conscription
  - strong echos of Charter Oath in abolishing the evil practices of the past
  - samurai were described as a leech class
  - needed to return to the ancient system where everyone could be called to serve the emperor
- Ending the samurai monopoly on military service
  - Popular resistance and limitations
    - some peasants were not happy about this, as some say it as a "blood tax" and it was inspired
      by the West
    - in 1870s, less than 3% of viable population was conscripted, with only 43,000 in its combined
      armed forced (for reference, Germany has more than a million soldiers)
  - Changing appearances (Ending the warrior “look”)
    - embraces western style uniforms and hair
    - also got rid of the practice of carrying two swords

### 4. A New Taxation System

- implementation of a new taxation system
- Mutsu Munemitsu (1844-97) comes up with a plan (adopted in 1872) to end the system of collected in
  rice in favor of collecting them in cash, and a national survey of the value of land and official
  recognition of land ownership
- Political concerns about regional inequalities
  - Fiscal concerns
  - Mutsu Munemitsu and the new land tax
  - Taxes in cash not kind
  - Problems with the new system
