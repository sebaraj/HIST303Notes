# Lecture 8 - September 24, 2024 - "Rever the Emperor! Expel the Barbarian"

## Lecture Outline

### 1. The Sakuradamon Incident (March 1860)

- Samurai from the Mito and Satsuma domains attacked Ii's Palanquin and killed him

### 2. Daimyo division over the Perry treaty

- 1854: Abe Masahiro and the decision to survey Daimyo opinion to determine response to Perry
  - differing response from daimyo's forces him to not "listen" to one group of powerful daimyo &
    forced to resign over handling;
- Tokugawa Nariaki and allies opposed to treaty, Nariaki urges war
- Ii Naosuke urges development of international trade

### 3. The Issue of Shogunal Succession

- 13th Shogun, Tokugawa Iesada sickly and weak
- In 1857, issue of his succession becomes increasing meaningful
- Division over who should succeed him
- Obvious successor = Tokugawa Yoshitomi (Daimyo of Kii), who was supported by Ii Naosuke and the Vassal Daimyo
  - issue was that he was still a child
  - vassal daimyo: families who were loyal Tokugawa during the war are the ones who really serve
    in the positions of power/running things in the bakufu. wanted a child in power so they don't
    have strong opposition in the form of a grown up shogun
- Tokugawa Nariaka and allies support Tokugawa Keiki of Hitotsubashi
  - The Hitotsubashi Party
  - Satsuma was seen as an "enemy daimyo"
    - Didn't join tokugawa in the warring states period, but were too big/important to crush
  - Tokugawa Nariaki (Mito) and Matsudaira Keiei (Fukui) were related to the Tokugawa
  - important: these men were excluded from the bakufu power/running the government
    - either excluded b/c they were seen as the enemy or were "too prestigious"
  - Tokugawa Keiki was the son of Tokugawa Nariaki, but adopted by Hitotsubashi family (to continue
    their male daimyo line)

### 4. The Issue of a Commercial Treaty (Townsend Harris)

- Hotta Masayoshi - tries to get approval of the Emperor
  - Hotta is the one who succeeds Abe Masahiro after he steps down
- The Emperor's compromise = voice disapproval of the treaty, but also refuse to support Keiki for
  shogun
  - frustrates everyone, especially Hotta, who spends his life trying to get the emperor's support
    but is told his treaty is a stain on Japan
  - forced to resign, and is replaced by Ii Naosuke

### 5. Resolution? Ii Naosuke as Regent

- His family is one of the most prestigious of all of the vassal daimyo
- Armies that he provided to the Tokugawa were known as the red devils (strong military force)
- has the child appointed as shogun, and himself appointed as regent
- then, approves commericial treaty with the US
- carries out ruthless purge of his critics (Onse purge), and targets Tokugawa, Nariaki (house
  arrest), Tokugawa Keiki (banned from Edo castle), some other daimyo are forced to retire, and
  lower level politicians are killed/forced to retire
- angers many in the Mito domain and across Japan, as they see it as disrespect to their daimyos
- upsets many b/c of the treaty with the Americans
- reaction is to try to bind the Tokugawa family and the imperial family closer together

### 6. Reaction: The Rise of the Political Violence

- assassination of Ii ushers in period of intense political violence
  - example of killing Ii leading to successful change sets precedent
- The "Men of Spirit" (_shishi_)
  - young, ambitious, often idealistic
  - Terrorists or Patriots?
  - Foreign traders eventually became targets as well
  - Townsend's secretary, Henry Heusken, is killed in Edo
  -
