# Lecture 9 - September 26, 2024 - Thought and Action in the Bakumatsu Years

## Lecture Outline

### 1. The Intellectual Milieu of the Late Tokugawa Period

- The Mito School – Vocabulary and Framework

  - "revere the emperor, expel the barbarian"
  - Aizawa Seishisai (1782-1863)
  - Mito school argues talks about a "reinvigoration of the Tokugawa system"
    - when domains (such as Mito) build their own navies, and get more power, they can help the
      shogun and the emperor

- Tokugawa Nativism/National Learning ( = Kokugaku)

  - Begins as a literary movement, focused on reading ancient japanese texts
  - Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801)
    - first person to believe that the national spirit of Japan had been corrupted/lost due to the
      importation of Chinese/foreign culture
    - believed that the Japanese should return to antiquity, when Japan had a healthier/more
      wholesome society, when the gods/nature were connected to the people through a more active
      emperor
    - remember, line of emperors was unbroken, unlike in China/other countries
      - used as jsutification for the emperor to have more power
  - sense of unease among the wealthy Japanese, and the allue of the times in antiquity when
    everyone lived in peace was strong
  - Hirata Atsutane (1776-1843)
    - spread the ideas of Norinaga/other kokugaku scholars
    - turns these concepts into a political movement
    - when the different schools of though, the Mito school and the kokugaku school, come together,
      they form a powerful force that can be used to challenge the bakufu
      - meaning of "Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarian" changes from "reinvigorate the
        Tokugawa system" to "restore antiquity/restore the ancient system of imperial rule" as the
        emperor was that link
      - "expel the barbarian" = get rid of the foreigners, who are corrupting the Japanese spirit

- From “Reinvigorating” the Tokugawa System to “Restoring Antiquity/Restoration of the Ancient
  System of Imperial Rule”

### 2. The Bakufu Response to the “Men of Spirit”

- After the assassination of Ii Naosuke in 1860, Bakufu policy shifts to a more conciliatory stance
  with the Mito/Tokugawa Nativist schools of thought
- “Unifying the Court and the Bakufu”
  - Marriage of Shōgun Iemochi and Princess Kazunomiya (sister of the emperor) in 1861 (after
    assassinaton of Ii Naosuke)
    - intended to make it clear that that the bakufu and the court were working together
    - emperor was originally reluctant, but was eventually convinced
  - Renegotiate with the Western powers to secure delay of opening of additional treaty ports
    - sends a group of high ranking delegates to the west, convinced western powers to delay the
      opening of the treaty ports until 1868 was seen as a success for the bakufu in holding its own
      authority
  - Note: Tokugawa Nariaki also dies in 1860. and the death of Ii and Nariaki leads to a power vacuum
    in the bakufu
    - first threat to power came from the Choshu domain

### 3. The Great Domains and the Bakufu

- daimyo of choshu did not go to battle with the tokugawa forces in the warring states period, but were too powerful to crush, so were excluded from the bakufu
- Chōshū plan to mediate between the Bakufu and Court

  - court originally shows interest in the choshu plan, but just as things are going well, the
    Satsuma domain marches on Kyoto with 1000 of his men (without prior Bakufu approval)

    - Satsuma under Shimazu Hisamitsu (1817-1887) (father of the daimyo of Satsuma)

  - catches the bakufu leaders by surprise, and when he gets to Kyoto, suggests that the court
    should be even stronger in their demands, and to get more from the Bakufu
  - tells bakufu that the only way to get out of this mess was the put the Hitotsubashi party in power
  - this is the first time that the bakufu is seen as weak, and the daimyo are seen as strong
  - bakufu is forced to ease up on the "alternate attendance" requirements for the daimyo
  - every daimyo is allowed to invest in his own armies/navies
  - Matsudaira Keiei does also make the Bakufu stronger, but also the daimyo stronger
  - ends up alienating the traditional bakufu supporters

### 4. Satsuma in the early 1860s

- The Teradaya Inn Incident – Satsuma and the “Men of Spirit”
  - Ōkubo Toshimichi and Saigō Takamori
  - forces the more radical people from Satsuma into line
  - convinces the loyalists that there is not point to work independently in the domain, but
    through it
  - results in Satsuma becoming a tight political unit, with Okubo and Saigo leading the men of
    spirit to work in the domain's best interest under Shimazu
- The Namamugi Incident and the British Bombardment of Kagoshima
  - British merchant is killed by Satsuma samurai, and the British demand compensation from the
    Bakufu; Bakufu demands compensation from Satsuma
  - Satsuma refuses, so after a year attempted to negotiate the British bombard Kagoshima (Satsuma
    capital)
  - Satsuma is forced to pay the British, and the British leave
  - Satsuma is seen as a powerful domain, and the bakufu is seen as weak
    - "at least were standing up to these barbarians"
  - but due to cost, Satsuma is forced to withdraw their contribution to politics/Kyoto
    - men of spirit see this as their chance

### 5. The Radicalization of Chōshū

- Chōshū and the “Men of Spirit”
  - Tokugawa Keiki and the call to “Expel the Barbarian”
  - alliance comes to dominate the emperor's capital of Kyoto
  - start pushing the idea that the bakufu actually do something
- new 26-year old shogun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, is seen as weak, and the bakufu is seen as weak
  - hard to balance the bakufu and the daimyo/emperor
  - sets bait
    - Attacking Western shipping from Shimonoseki
    - Choshu domain attacks western ships, and the bakufu sees Choshu's actions as outward
      insurrection
    - Sends other daimyo to expel the Men of Spirit in the capital
  - Domains face serious problems
    - Mito decends into civil war, basically removing it as a political force
    - Choshu being expelled marks the end of the "expel the barbarian" movement
    - allies bombard Shimonoseki (in Choshu)
  - The Bakufu Response – Aizu and Satsuma in Kyoto
    - many important leaders in Kyoto die in 1864
  - The Western Response – Allied Military Action
