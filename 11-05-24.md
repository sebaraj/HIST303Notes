# Lecture 17 - November 5, 2024 - Manufacturing Modernity: Barracks/Schools/Factories

## Lecture Outline

1. Picturing modernity: Sakurada Parade Ground, Tokyo

- foreground (hustle + bustle) vs. background (organized military)

2. Barracks and conscription

- could get out of conscription by school, bribes, being a doctor, etc (French style)
- usually only took one son from each family
- exempting the male heads of household b/c they pay taxes
- west called conscription "the blood tax", which fueled anxiety about it within the Japanese
  populus
- in 1883, major reform on conscription system
  - new structure: 3 years of active duty, 4 years of first reserve service, and 5 years of second
    reservice
  - affluent still were able to get around by paying to only have to serve 3 years active service
- note: The Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) was a major influence on the Japanese conscription system
  - Japan sees this as a model, and shift to the Prussian/German model of an army/conscription
- In 1888, the garrison system (focused mainly on being ready to respond to civil uprising systems
  within the country) is refocused into the possibility of overseas deployment, with a system of
  independent divisions who would be ready to deploy overseas.
  - 7 divisions established and movement to establish a modern Navy
- conscipriton was still not popular, and doctors who could get patients out of it were still
  popular
- evidence that into the 1880s, the army still had credibility problems in the eyes of the samurai,
  and resentment of people who were conscripted from peasant families
- there are other ways to see the culture of the military spreading to common aspects of society
  - good example is the schooling system

3. Schools and education

- in 1872, government set out to create a modern education system
  - also inspired by the Iwakura mission
- in the early Meiji period, rapid expansion of this system
- not superwell organized + expensive in its early years
- Mori Ariori (Satsuma) was the first minister of education
  - samurai; founds the Meiroki-sha
  - becomes minister of education in 1885
  - believes that education can be used to build up the nation
    - values that most need to be taught applied knowledge + with scholarship being restricted to
      the academic elite
    - bedrock of knowledge to be taught in elementary schools
  - not focused on critical thinking
  - attendence to elementary school was made mandatory for 4 years, with the ability to extend to 4
    more years if parents wanted
  - required parents to pay for 4 year elementary education, but provided a free 3-year education
    (but came with stigma, so most tried to send to 4 year)
  - in 1887, only 40% of children were attending elementary school, but by 1905, 90% were attending
    (boys and girls)
  - In 1900, free public education is introduced
  - he was assassinated in 1889
- middle schools and high schools were also established, but were like a pyramid, where only a few
  could attend
- also set up private universities
- but pinnacle of the system were the imperial universities, most important of all was Tokyo
  Imperial University
  - main gateway into the imperial bureaucracy
  - Remember Yamakawa Kenjiro
    - first Japanese graduate of Yale
    - first professor of physics at Tokyo Imperial University
    - president of Tokyo Imperial University and Kyoto Imperial University
    - founder and president of Kyushu Imperial University
- also set up normal schools to train teachers
- Higher Normal School (Tokyo) ca. 1887
- taught middle school teachers and those that taught at the normal schools
- Mori wanted to use military drills/discipline within the normal schools, as they were getting the reputation
  of being too relaxed
- punishments/trials to address behavioral concerns
  - anxiety caused by these led to them sleeping in their uniforms in case of nightly drills
  - gave birth to fiercely strict teachers, who were teaching other teachers/educators
  - this leads to new sense of tension/discipline within the school system
-

4. Nation building, the "Emperor system," and the New Technologies of Discipline

- school reading of the imperial rescript on education
- ceremonies with emperor's/empress's images behind them, with various school readings/announcements
- lead to significant reordering of many people's lives
- idealized vision of how space/time should be organized within education

5. Factories and the Industrial Revolution

- Shiubusawa Eiichi - Osaka Cotton Spinning Company
  - sets up numerous companies/factories that drive Japanese industrialization
  - prioritize cheap labor, recruiting young girls from the countryside and housing them in dorms
- industrialization was really driven by the female workforce (3/5 were women, with remaining 2/5
  men being more likely to be supervisors, etc)
