# Lecture 10 - October 1, 2024 - The Meiji Restoration

## Lecture Outline

### 1. The “Men of Spirit” and the Idea of Restoration

- “Restoration of the Ancient System of Imperial Rule”
- Rather than work with the status quo, the men of spiriti came to believe it was necessary to
  completely get rid of the bakufu and restore the emperor to power (wihtout the aide of the warrior
  governemmt)
- In 1864, important to note that the men of spirit were not in a position to overthrow the Tokugawa
- Meanwhile, Choshu (southwest domain) which provided these radicals their strongest support, seemed to be
  facing disaster from the Western bombardment
- Bakufu decides that Choshu must be punished (Chastise Choshu), so armies from 34 domains are sent
  to Choshu.

### 2. Whither Chōshū?

- The Bakufu’s campaign to “Chastise Chōshū!”
- But somehow in only 4 years, Choshu gains massive power and is in the position to change the
  goernemnt to put the emperor back in power
- first step: bakufu calls off invasion of Choshu b/c conservatives within Choshu issue formal
  apology and agree to purge the radicals who were behind this
- But very soon after, the radicals make a comeback, and are able to reassert their control in
  Choshu

  - Key figure: Kido Koin (1833-77)
    - Mid-ranking samurai
    - Very sympathetic to the radicals and sees this as an opportunity for Choshu to assert
      itself on a national stage
    - Choshu "Kihetai" (Irregular Militia)
      - recruited from all parts of society, not just the
        samurai class
      - very open to using Western military tactics/technology
      - initially seems ironic b/c these are the "expel the barbarian" people, but recall Yoshida
        Shoin, who was convinced that the only way to expel the barbarian was to learn from them
        - Shoin taught other Choshu samurai like Kido Koin

- Western bombardment of Shimonoseki (in Choshu) demonstrates that the Choshu have much to learn,
  leading to acceptance of the need to enact bold new measures for its own strength

### 3. The Satsuma-Chōshū (Sat-Chō) Alliance

- Choshu looked for allies and found one in Satsuma (southwestern most domain)

  - both historical enemies of the Tokugawa bakufu but both have good reason to be enemies
  - Satsuma has been the domain that has always upstaged Choshu when Choshu that tried to make a
    name for itself and are also the ones who encourage the bakufu to get rid of the radicals in
    Choshu

- Shifting to the Tosa domain, (in the early 1860s) the radical ideas of the important of the
  imperial family had also taken hold
  - Men of spirit try to get power, but are eventually pushed out and forced to move elsewhere.
    - One of those in exile was Sakamoto Ryoma (1835-67)
      - Initially known for being an excellent swordsman, but eventually becomes a very important
        figure in the Meiji Restoration
      - towards end of 1862, as he is forced to move out, he decides to make a name for himself by
        assassinating someone (Katsu Kaishu)
- Katsu Kaishū and the Bakufu Navy
  - Katsu Kaishu gets ahead by starting with Dutch studies, which contributes to his rise within the
    bakufu
  - Katsu Kaishu gets put in change of the first Japanese steam ship, and after he returns, he is
    put in change of building up the bakufu's navy
  - But when Sakamoto Ryoma tries to kill him, Katsu Kaishu presents how japan is on the verge of
    falling to the Western powers, and the only way to survive is to build up their military strenth
    as quickly as possible, especially the navy. ends up recruiting Sakamoto Ryoma to work for him
  - goes well until 1864, when the the change in the bakufu leadership leads to Katsu Kaishu losing
    his job
  - Sakamoto Ryoma arranges for some of his buddies in Satsuma to taken Katsu Kaishu in, and he
    becomes a very important figure in the Satsuma-Choshu alliance
- Satsuma and Choshu don't directly talk, but the Tosa people that moved there created a network of
  communication and eventually leads to a secret alliance
- Comes at a horrible time for the bakufu
  - “Chastise Chōshū” (Take two)
  - but not, Satsuma has a secret alliance with Choshu, and decides not to fight against Choshu.
  - other domains arent keen in fighting Choshu, so the new coallition assembled is a lot weaker &
    the troops are less motivated. meanwhile, Choshu has been building up their military strength, so
    when Bakufu forces arrive, they are routed by the Choshu forces
  - but around this time, the Shogun dies, so the bakufu forces retreat (but everybody knows that
    they were defeated)

### 4. Towards Restoration!

- Ee ja nai ka? (What the heck? Let's just party!)
  - people start dancing throughout the streets
  - feeds into the sense of chaos and that the bakufu is losing control
- Leads to another change in the Bakufu leadership, when Tokugawa Keiki (some of Tokugawa Nariaki) becomes Shogun
  - immediately starts pushing for reforms, but ends up alienating the traditional bakufu supporters
    and is a case of too little, too late from the radicals
  - Keiki asks the French for military support
  - meanwhile, Choshu and Satsuma are getting closer to the British
- French v. British? Towards Partition?
  - Iwakura Tomomi (1825-83) of the imperial court, starts to make calls from within the court for
    imperial restoration
    - Note: the recent emperor just died and was replaced by a 15-year-old emperor (who was easily
      manipulated by the court)
- Sakamoto Ryoma suggests a new government that would be a coalition of the daimyo and the court
  - 1.
  - 2. have a bicamerel legislature (bakufu represented in upper house and men of spirit in the
       lower house)
  - 3. have a japanese army/navy be built up

### 5. The Fall of the Bakufu

- The Sat-Chō coup (allied with Tosa + )

- Keiki’s resigns, becoming the last shogun in November 1867 and relinquishes the rights of any of
  his descendants to the shogunate
  - not enough in the radicals' eyes, so they secure custody of the boy emperor and issue an edict
    that the Tokugawa families give up all of their land/holdings
  - Tokugawa refuses, so imperial forces meet the Tokugawa forces and are routed
  - important to note is that the Tokugawa received very little support from the other daimyo
- Sat-cho target Aizu b/c in 1864 Aizu helped clean up radicals in Choshu: Chastise Aizu!
  - but scale of fighting across the country was limited
  - due to Tokugawa Keiki recognizing that a full scale civil war was not good for anyone
- When imperial forces arrive at Edo, Keiki decides to put Katsu Kaishu in charge of the Bakufu
  forces, agreeing that the bakufu forces/Edo will surrender peacefully
- relatively peaceful transition of power, and emperor was restored to his ancient position of power
