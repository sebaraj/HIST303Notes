  - trained in germany, military general
  - dominates the political life in the first decade of the 20th century
- Continuation of the conservative reaction of the 1890s
  - under him, the more progressive trends of the meiji period continue in full swing, but he was a
    relatively conservative figure
  - after the Russo-Japanese War, the position of dominance in Korea is formalized via the
- Emperor-centered ideology

#### 2. The Annexation of Korea

- Korean-Japanese Convention 1905
- Itō Hirobumi as Resident General 1906-1909
  - Ito Hirobumi (awarded honorary degree from Yale) is asked to go to Korea to handle that problem
  - believed that Korea should still maintain some level of independence so that the reforms needed
    to bring Korea into the modern world were accepted by the Korean people
  - tried to play the friendly grandfather role (remember picture of Ito and Yi Eun, the crown
    prince of Korea)
  - many Koreas were not thrilled about this power relationship
  - resigns in 1909
- Itō’s Assassination by An Chung-gun 1909
  - but by that point, he was already the face of the most agrressive aspects of Japanese
    imperialism in Korea, so soon after, An Chung-gun (Korean) assassinates him while Ito was giving a
    speech in manchuria
  - An Chung-gun is a hero in Korea (stamp, museum, etc)

  - by the end of August 1910, Japanese establish an underclared state of marshall law, increase
    their military presense, and place a puppet government in place
  - marks the end of the Korean Kingdom, and the beginning of the Japanese colonial period (for ~3
    decades until the end of WWII)
- now Japan was a colonial power, emulating its western fellow empires
  - this fueled the rise of Japanese nationalism, and the Meiji emperor is seen as having made this
    possible
    - he is exalted as a savior of the nation, and underlying that were the older nativist ideas
      that the imperial family decended from the gods and the emperor was this semi-divine figure

#### 3. The Great Treason Incident

- The rise of socialist, anarchist, and communist groups
  - rise of small groups of believers in Japan
  - saw themselves as heirs to the most radical traditions of the movement for freedom and popular
    rights
  - the new movement, like the earlier movement for freedom and popular rights, was noted for
    including many women
    - one of the most controversial was Kanno Suga (1881-1911)
      - from a downwardly mobile family
      - when she was 15, her stepmother arranged for her to be raped to be "put in her place"
      - one of the soures of solice was in the writing of a socialist writer (who also wrote to rape
        victims to tell them not to blame themselves or feel shame/guilt for what happened to them)
      - joined the Heiminsha (Commoner's Society)
    - Kotoku Shusui (1871-1911) (Tosa; student of Nakae Chomin’s)
      - also a member of the Heiminsha
      - was a journalist, and was arrested for his writings
    - Heiminsha was targeted as a group by the Japanese government
      - anti-war, pro-peace
    - Kanno Suga becomes convinced that the only way to change the system was to kill the emperor
      - caught in a plot to kill the emperor with a bomb (Great Treason Incident)
      - in the end, her and her co-conspirators were betrayed to the police
      - used by the Meiji government to round up everyone involved with the socialist movement,
        including Kotoku Shusui
    - Okabe Nagamoto (1855-1925) (Minister of Justice) (Yale Association of Japan President)
      - originally born the daimyo of a domain
      - presided over the show trial of the conspirators
      - of the 24, 11 were executed on january 11, 1911, and one day later, Kanno Suga was executed
      - the 10 others were sentenced to death, but commuted to life in prison by the emperor

#### 4. The Death of the Meiji Emperor

- The Emperor’s death as a “symbolic crisis”
  - but two years later, the emperor was on the verge of death
  - remember, it was for him that so many Japanese men had gone to war
  - Meiji leaders were worried that the emperor's death would lead to the crisis that Kanno Suga had
    tried to create
  - as a response, they very quickly prepare for an elaborate funeral
- Tradition and the funeral of the Meiji Emperor
  - to remind the Japanese people of the illustrious past of the imperial family and the unbroken
    chain of emperors for the past 2500 years
