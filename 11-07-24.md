# Lecture 18 - November 7, 2024 - The Mixed Blessings of Modernity: Treaty Revision, Punishment and the Colonization of Hokkaido

### Lecture Outline

#### 1. Tokugawa Punishments and Extraterritoriality

- **Cesare Beccaria** and **John Howard**
  - Beccaria's _Of Crimes and Punishments_ (1764)
  - laid the foundation of the modern penal system
  - "cruel and unusual punishment" came from this
  - Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia
    - first building in the country to have indoor plumbing
      - becomes a course of pride/tourism
- ultimately leads to rethinking of punishment/change over time
  - in 19th century, the division of time (us in the present vs them in the past), were also divided
    geographically (i.e. the west has civilized punishments, while some areas/the rest of the world
    did not)
  - important in the context of gunboat diplomacy/Extraterritorial provisions in the unequal
    treaties
    - the types of punishments still being used in Japan were seen as barbaric
      - crucifixion, harakiri, burning alive (at the stake), display of severed heads (gokumon),
        standard decapitation, public floggings, and tattooing (marking body as criminal)
  - in this system, imprisonment was not seen as a punishment, as jails were only a way to hold
    people until sentencing

#### 2. Treaty Revision and Early Meiji Reforms

- whenever the discussion of treaty revision came up, the issue of punishment was also brought up
  by the west
- Earl Gray (House of Lords) was worried about the possibility of another expensive foreign war
  and suggests to throw the Tokugawa a bone and remake the treaties such that the two countries are
  more equal
  - In response, John Russul (British Foreign Secretary) rebukes this, saying that the Japanese
    were backwards
- does not take long for the status-conscious Japanese leaders to realize that their Tokugawa era
  punishments were seen as a central symbol as backwardness
  - reforming the penal system should be a priority in order to revise the treaties with the west
  - soon after the restoration, a Justice Ministry was established
    - the **Gyōbusho** (Ministry of Punishments), which eventually becomes a Justice Ministry
      - banned tattoing, crucifixion, and many other "barbaric" forms of punishment

#### 3. Hokkaido and the Central Prison System

- **OHARA Shigechika** (1834-1902)
  - a former samurai who was sent to study in the US
  - made in charge of the old Tokugawa prisons
  - originally spent some time in the prisons, but after he was released, became interested in the
    western prison system
  - he was the one who pushed for the modernization of the penal system
  - In 1870, he makes an appointment with Kido Koin to discuss the need to study the western prison
    system
  - Kido agrees and sends him to Hong Kong/Singapore to study the prison system
    - why Hong Kong/Singapore? because they were British colonies which had a large rice-eating
      population, and Japan was also a rice-eating population (providing a good comparison, as food
      was a major part of the prison system)
- Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon
  - a prison design that allowed for the constant surveillance of prisoners
  - the idea was that the prisoners would always be watched, and therefore would always be on their
    best behavior
  - this idea was taken up by OHARA and used in the design of the new prisons
- **Kangoku** = "Surveillance jail" i.e. Modern prison
  - Ohara comes back to Japan and also starts advocating for other changes
    - elimination of flogging for short sentences
    - eliminiation of the death penalty for life in prison
    - use of hanging by gallows instead of beheading
- Prison was seen as a way to discipline and expel the evil, not simply to punish
- After the Satsuma Rebellion, the government can't just execute them all, so it serves as a trigger
  for a new interest to build new prisons
- **Miyagi Prison** (1874) in Sendai
  - the biggest wooden building in Japan at the time
  - very similar to Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia
  - first modern prison in Japan
  - can only hold 1000 prisoners, but Japan needs more
- leads to construction of series of rebellions
- Satsuma rebels were forced to make the bricks with advice by the British, and those bricks were
  used to build new prisons/paved roads
- Ito Hirobumi (younger Choshu on the Iwakura mission)
  - recognizes that Hokkaido is could be conquered by the Russians very easily
  - decides to take over Hokkaido, but the issue is that there is not a lot of labor in Hokkaido
  - decides to send prisoners up to Hokkaido, and after they finishes their sentences, they would
    stay in Hokkaido
  - team was sent to Hokkaido to build a prison in 1880
  - using an Inu guide, they find a place to build the prison and by 1881, the prison is built

#### 4. Reform and the Legacies of Prison Labor

- in 1876, the total prison population was 16,000, but by 1882, it was 32,000
  - freedom of popular rights movement was a big reason for this
  - Matsuoka deflation (1876) was another reason
- succeed in drafting their first penal code being helped by the French
- Japanese government uses this new-found labor to push ahead in their mining enterprises and really
  build out the infrastructure for the modern colonization of Hokkaido (highways, agriculture, etc.)
- working conditions in Hokkaido were attrocious (1 in 10 died from being worked to death)
  - but this was actually pretty deliberate
  - Kaneku Kentaro (1853-1942) was a central proponent, basically blaming the prisoners for not
    being able to cope; kill them off, cost us less, win-win
- Japanese
