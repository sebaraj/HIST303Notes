# Lecture 11 - October 3, 2024 - Monarchy and Oligarchy: Consolidating the New National Leadership

## Lecture Outline

### 1. **Meiji – an era of “Enlightened Rule”?**

- The Charter Oath
- “An Illuminating Historical Context”?

### 2. **The Oligarchs**

- Iwakura Tomomi – court noble
  - high ranking court noble, but sympathetic to the radicals
  - as a result, was exiled from the court, but returned to Kyoto in 1867
  - had close ties to satsuma
  - organizes group of nobles to support the radicals, including Sanjo Sanetomi (1837-91), who had close ties
    to choshu
  - wins over the boy-emperor's materal grandfather, who is the most powerful person in the court,
    and gets direct access to the emperor
  - Beginning of 1867, Iwakura confronts some powerful lords with the emperor's decree
  - important to note: Choshu is not actively involved in this yet and not all the domains involved
    in the restoration were hostile to the Tokugawa
  - Tosa + Echizen actively promoted some kind of compromise
    - they want a great council of lords, which would include Tokugawa Keiki, the last shogun
    - but Satsuma is strongly against this. they want to get rid of the bakufu
- Ōkubo Toshimichi and Saigō Takamori (Satsuma)
  - Okubo insists the only way to fully get rid of the bakufu was to strip Tokugawa Keiki of his
    land and titles
    - leads to battle, where 10,000 bakufu troops are defeated by 4000 Satsuma and Choshu troops
  - Saigo worked closely with Okubo to exclude the Tokugawa when establishing a new regime
    - ends up securing the successful handover of Edo to imperial forces
    - mainly a battlefield commander
- Kido Kōin (Chōshū)
  - Okubo and Kido are the two most important figures in the new government
- These three men consistute the first generation of Meiji oligarchs
  - Obuko and Saigo recognize that sucuring western recognition of the new government would be
    important
  - encourage emperor to allow audiences with foreign diplomats
- However, there were a number of court nobles, led by the emperor's grandfather, who thought that
  they should be in power. wanted a real monarchy, not an oligarchy and wanted a stronger stance
  towards the Western powers
  - at the same time, some Daimyo (led by the lords of Tosa and \_\_) wanted a council of lords
  - accussed the 3 oligarchs of using the emperor as a puppet to seize power for themselves

### 3. **The question of legitimacy and the power of “state ritual”**

- The Charter Oath in context

  - Jimmu, the first emperor, gained a resurgence in worship
  - formal ceremony (recall lecture) marked first time where emperor had been seen in public in
    centuries and not just as a passive symbol, but as someone who was issuing orders
  - Okubo demanded (and got) the emperor to appear before the people, to move them to tears and
    shock them to silence with a single command
  - Okubu and Kido designed this ceremony to quell any doubts about the legitimacy of the new
    government, Tokugawa Keiki not having an role in the new government, and the emperor's
    grandfather and his court supporters not having any power regarding the emperor

- Answers to “the Four Questions”
  - Kido Koin was the key figure in writing the Charter Oath
  - written to any people that might challenge their power
  - written to establish the emperor's legitimacy and consolidate the power of the oligarchy by
    using the image of the emperor
  - Once its issued, it began to take a like of its own
  -

### 4. **The Role of the Monarch**

- Symbol of a new era – Western clothes
  - by 1871, the emperor was wearing western clothes similar to western monarchs
  - his advisors also start wearing western clothes
- The new “Eastern Capital” = Tōkyō

  - plans a series of grand trips across the country, and that the emperor needs a new capital
    - keen on Osaka, but is rejected fairly quickly as most of the resistance to the new government
      was in the northeastern part of the country
    - eventually settles on Edo, which is renamed Tokyo
    - Kyoto would be renamed to Saikyo (eastern capital)
  - emperor makes first trip to Tokyo in 1868 but is not impressed by the city
    - partly due to alternate attendence being relaxed, resulting in a drop of ~100,000 people in
      the city
    - economic conditions also led to people moving out of the city (think about Detroit and people
      leaving)
    - city was mostly peacefully surrendered
    - large Tokugawa shrine was burned down though

- Popular views of the Emperor in 1868
  - irreverence towards the emperor was wide spread
  -
