# Lecture 2 - September 3, 2024 - The Tokugawa Order

## Lecture Outline

### 1. Historiography: "Before the Dawn"?

- "Before the Dawn" (1929), written by Shimazaki Toson (1872 - 1943)
  - Trances experiences of people who lived before the Meiji restoration
  - novel captures the notion that a new era is coming (in 1868)
  - those who lived before this "new dawn" were part of a benighted age and were searching for a
    better future
  - Meiji directly translated to "light governance" or "enlightened rule"
  - implied Tokugawa period (pre-1868) was a backward time
- Benighted Tokugawa period v. Enlightened Meiji?
- People who are citical to the new regime focus on the continual of bad things
  from the Tokugawa period into the Meiji restoration (both parties agree that the Tokugawa period
  was bad)
- After the second world war, there was a huge Japanese self reflection on how/why a fascist
  government was able to take control
  - Point to the feudal remnants, from the old Tokugawa period, that lead to the authoritarianism - Only reinforces that idea that the old regime was a mainly negative thing, and the Meiji
    period hadn't gone far enough
- Stating in the late 1950s, a group of American scholars started to promote a different
  interpretation of the Japanese past
  - They actually highlighted Japan as a non-western country that Japan had succeeded in the face of
    Western imperialism
    - Scholars often looked back to Tokugawa period and highlighted many of the positive aspects,
      like the high levels of math and literacy
    - Valued the spirit of hard-work and frugality, sharing the "protestant work-ethic", which led
      to a smooth transition to a modern capitalist world
    - Within the context of the Cold War, the arguments often took an ideological dimension
      - Assuming more than America/Western Europe was the only way to measure success in a
        non-western nation
      - Also becomes a powerful source of critique in Japan and eventually in the US
      - American scholars did not highlight the negative aspects of Japanese culture (in Tokugawa), contrasting from
        how Japanese scholars view those events
- Things start to move in the other direction within Japan itself
  - People start to value their past, looking to the Tokugawa period
  - More emphasis is now placed on the complexity/nuance rather than just purely good/bad
- In the Tokugawa period, people came to understand that it was an unprecedented era of peace

### 2. An Era of Peace

- "Warring States"

  - Era of unprecedented war, where the political society broke down into a state of constant
    civil war
  - Towards the end of the century, more powerful war lords emerged and were able to form alliances

- "Three Great Unifiers"

  - Oda Nabunaga
    - Received guns through the Portuguese and used them to dominate the battlefield
    - Comes closer than any of his predecesors in uniting his country
    - Famous for being ruthless (in pursuit of his enemies, including Buddhist temples, and his
      ambition) - Contributes to his success, but also backfires when his Lt.
  - One of his Lt., Toyotomi Hideyoshi, took over after Oda is killed

    - In order to create a new political order, he federates conquest
    - Rather than continuing on a campaign of total conquest, he builts an alliance with the
      carrot-stick model
    - Good for the daimyos, as there was little trust among daimyos and their own Lts.
    - Contributes to momentum towards peace
    - Having risen up from very humble origins, he also understands that in order to have an era
      of peace, you cannot have an armed population, and creates a campaign to collect
      swords/disarm the population
    - In conjunction, also implements a policy of seperating peasants and warriors by setting up
      military camps, to prevent the exploitation of unarmed peasants
    - Leads to wave of urbanization, with the camps turning in cities (castle towns)
    - Launches national Cadastral surveys, laying the foundation for an enduring system of taxation
      for the rest of the Tokugawa period
      - Makes the decision to not collect taxes in money, even through money is circulating and
        there is a cash economy. Chooses to collect taxes in rice
    - But is a megalomaniac, launching an attack into China by starting an invasion into Korea
      - Was brutal (mound of ears in Japan) and not remembered fondly in the rest of Asia
      - People of Korea fought back, and were eventually successful in their defense
    - At home, he also has issues: cannot produce a male heir
      - Finally produces a male heir, but the child is still very young when Hideyoshi dies
      - So, he appoints a council of lords/trusted allies

  - Tokugawa Ieyasu was the most powerful lords in that council
    - Turns out to also have a lot of ambition
      - Leads to the last great battle of the warring states: In 1600, Battle of Sekigahara.
      - Establishes Tokugawa as the dominant leader of the period
    - emperor did not have a standing army and was mainly seen as a spiritual leader, but has this
      historical clout
    - Tokugawa has himself declared as Shogun, creating a shogunate/bakafu, but keeps the emperor in "power" to have more
      legitimacy (eventually topples Tokugawa regime in the Meiji restoration)
    - Very quickly makes his son Shogun to avoid issue of succession and works as a "retired" shogun
    - Rules with a carrot-stick model
    - Creates a classification system of Daimyos, laying out code and controling their behavior
      - At the core, creates a system of Alternate Attendance (_Sankin kotai_), forcing the
        daimyos to spend some time living in his new established capital, Edo (now Tokyo)
      - Constantly keeps the Daimyos in a state of financial stress, discouraging them from
        launching rebellions

### 3. Consequences of "the Great Peace"

- Tokugawa Ieyasu creates a highway system: with a mountain route (Nakasendo) and a coastal route (Tokaido)
- The largest city in the world: Edo
  - stimulates national (rice) market
  - leads to futures trading, etc
- Re-birth of the ancient capital: Kyoto (around 400,000 people by 1700)
- A national rice market: Osaka (around 500,000 people by 1700)
- Warriors and merchants
  - Age of the warrior is increasingly the age of the merchant
  - purchasing power of samurai salaries becomes less and less meaningful
  - Merchants were taxed in
