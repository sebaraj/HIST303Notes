# Lecture 7 - September 19, 2024 - Commodore Perry and the Catfish: Popular Culture and the Turmoil of the 1850s

## Lecture Ourline

### 1. The “Black Ships” and sources of information for ordinary people

- See the formation of increasingly sophisticated information networks
- Explosion of commercial publishing (especially in cities), giving birth to a vibrant, popular
  culture
- Highlights text and illustrations; reject movable print, but embrace woodblock printing, allowing
  the mixing of text and images
- Leads to the popularization of _Kawaraban_ “broadsheets” (text + images)
- Idea of the "Black Ship" had already been circulating in popular culture, so when Perry arrives,
  it is not a surprise
- At this arrival or each , there is a mass publication of broadsheets
- False reports and bravado
  - Americans try to impress Japanese when Perry lands w/ a minstral show
  - Japanese response: Use sumo wrestlers when moving things into the American ships to intimidate Americans
- People in Edo were concerned though, and many sent family/possessions away from the city
  - Many Samurai ran around to try to arm themselves, as many were not armed after years of
    peace/comfort
- Feeds the sense that everything is in chaos
- Laughter and mockery
- Note: Lord of Ise (Abe Masahiro, leader of Bakufu) was not respected by the people and seen as
  weak when he called for opinions on what to do about the Americans
  - also put out a call to ordinary people to come up with ideas, and people start to petition
    changes
- Leads to the broadsheet manufacterers trying to get the latest news out as quickly as possible
  (i.e. getting the latest scoop)

### 2. Yoshida Shōin and the craving for knowledge

- Yoshida Shōin (1830-59) — Chōshū domain
- Born as a low ranking samurai, but is often viewed as the spiritual father of the Meiji Restoration
- In his youth, he traveled all over Japan and is influenced by a wide range of ideas (including
  Aizawa Seishisai) and the idea that in order to beat your enemies, you must know them
- In keeping with that line of thought, when Perry returns for the second time, Yoshida recruits a
  friend to try to get passage to the US on Perry’s ship (to learn about the US)
- Letters are read by Samuel Wells Williams, so he sends them back and they are immediately arrested
- Shoin is sent back to Choshu and placed under house arrest
  - Sets up academy to train future leaders; ends up training many of the leaders of the Meiji
    Restoration/Meiji Japan
- He is eventually executed by the Bakufu (in 1859) for his role in the Sonno Joi movement

### 3. Social conditions and natural disasters

- In 1855, group of boys/kids play war games (with one group being the Japanese team and one being
  the American team). American side ultimately wins. When they play the next day, the Japanese leader
  (a 12 year old) brings a bamboo spear and kills the 14 y.o. American leader
  - When the authorities find out, they actually promote the kid to samurai status, giving him
    lifetime stipend
- Commoners were not in good shape; economic conditions deteriorate as Perry arrives
- The year after the treaties are signed, the Great Ansei Earthquake (1855) hits (epicenter at Edo
  Bay)
  - 7.0-8.4 on the Richter scale
  - ~4000 people died and ~2000 injured
  - Many people are left homeless
  - Leads to a lot of social unrest
- Leads to the rise of the _Namazu-e_ (catfish prints), which are satirical prints
  - catfish were believed to be the cause of earthquakes
  - many contained people "blaming" the catfish for their problems
-

### “The Catfish and the Barbarian” (trans. William Steele and Robert Eskildsen)

Catfish: You stupid Americans have been making fun of us Japanese for the past two or three years.
You have come and pushed us around too much. Since you came, Edo is all too noisy. Stop this useless
talk of trade, we don’t need it! We are sick of hearing the noisy calls of the candy sellers. We
don’t need you, so hurry up and put your back to us. Fix your rudder and sail away at once.

America: What are you talking about, you stupid catfish! Mine is a country of benevolence and
compassion. No matter what a person does, even if he is a laborer or a hunter, if he is benevolent
he can become king. That’s why many people want to come to my country and that’s why our country is
called “a country that gathers in people” (gasshi koku — trans. of “United States”). But there is
one thing which troubles us: we have too many people and not enough food to feed them. Therefore we
have come to Japan to get rice, radishes and chickens; but you just say no, and have not given us
anything. That’s why we keep coming back.

Catfish: Shut up, Perry. No matter how often you brag that your gasshu koku is a country of
benevolence, if you don’t have food you must be poor. If America had the Buddha or the gods then you
would have a good harvest of the five grains. But since you don’t, you have to depend upon piracy
and steal your food. Knowing this, the gods of our country have gathered together and have caused a
divine wind to sink your ships and those of the Russians. For sure in the eleventh month of last
year the gods struck out against your rudeness. I don’t want to listen to any of your empty words.

America: You catfish! It is funny for you to speak like that, making up your own reasoning. Despite
the fact that men can usually hold you down with a gourd, on the fourth day of the eleventh month
you tried to send us away by shaking Shimazu and Numazu, but our American spirit remained unmoved.

Catfish: You noisy hairy barbarian! If you don’t leave we’ll bury you in mud!

America: Go ahead and try; I’ll fight back with gun and bayonet!

Plasterer: Both of you be quiet. If you are far away listen carefully to my words; if you are close,
look with your eyes and see the cracks in the warehouses. We are asked to patch up these cracks and
holes; asked over and over again, we are asked to prop up the broken-down walls; we are known for
our fine work with the trowel. Everyone admires our work. We are thankful this time for the
earthquake, but both of you try to resolve your differences without causing us any trouble. We don’t
want to see it; stop it!
