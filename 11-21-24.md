# Lecture 22 - November 21, 2024 - Architecture and Diplomacy in the Imperial Capital

### Lecture Outline

#### 1. **Building a Modern Capital**

- Remember that state Edo was in after the Meiji Restoration; population decreased + many of the
  wealthy had left
- re-reached 1 million people by 1880s
- transitions from the Tokugawa period into the Meiji period brought a lot of foreigners
- Tsukiji Foreign Settlement and the “Hoteru-kan”

  - under the treaties signed by the Bakufu, the city of Edo was one of the places that was opened
    up for foreign residents (citizens/subjects of the treaty powers)
  - bakufu began building special foreign concession at Tsukiji (completed in 1869)
  - Afterwards, this was the place where foreigners were required to live
  - Consulates, HQs for foreign companies, and missionaries (who set up schools)
    - this draws many ambitions men (and women) to the mission schools, which eventually become many
      of the elite private schools in Japan
    - missionaries also built hospitals (now St. Luke's International Hospital)
  - foreigns are confined here to protect them from shi-shi type men, but to also prevent/limit
    unregulated kinds of mixing; from the outset, there is concern that good Japanese women from good
    families might have contact with western men, which would lead to a lot of unpleasentness
    - as such, the Meiji government built a red light district, where "bad" Japanese women could
      service the needs of these western men
    - red light district doesnt work well in Tokyo, as many of the men were missionaries
  - also first location of Japan's first hotel; building becomes a celebrated landmark
    - Tsukuji Hoteru-kan (i.e. Hotel-hotel)
    - used traditional Japanese building techniques to build what the Japanese thought was a western
      building
    - burned to the ground in 1872, as part of a large fire; significant b/c it opens up a large
      central part of the city for redevelopment

- Meiji government issues a new plan to rebuild this part of the city with a new technology to
  Japan (the brick) (architect: Thomas Waters), which becomes the Ginza district

  - gets its start as the place to go; becomes synonymous with the city of Tokyo
  - takes a while b/c people did not know how to fire bricks; so Waters had to teach them/set up the
    brick firing infrastructure
  - remember, the government at this point was struggling to pay its bills; so why did it embark on
    such an ambitious architectural project
    - the Japanese leaders were interested in fire proofing a city that was been historically prone
      to fires
    - also, the government was interested in creating a new kind of city that would be a showcase
      the new Japan; convince the western powers that Japan should treated as an equal/civilized
      country
      - no coincidence that the first train station was built very close to the Ginza district (by
      1876.
      -

- but many people were not enamored by the new Ginza district, so it was originally vacant; but over
  time, it became the place to hangout (known as Ginbura)
- New Forms of Transport: The Rickshaw and Trolleys
  - the rickshaw (spreading from Japan to other parts of Asia) is invented in Tokyo, and by the
    1870s, there were already 50,000 in Tokyo
  - if you moved into the city as a man, you could make a living pulling a rickshaw
  - part of the process that starts to lead to the recovery of the city's population
  - beginning of a revolution for urban transportation
- old daimyo's palace was confiscated and turned in the ministy of foreign afairs HQ
- Meiji Monuments: The First National Bank and the Twelve Storey Tower
  - established and becomes famous as a landmark in the 1870s
  - Ryounkaku Tower; first building in the country with an elevator; could go up to the 12th floor
    and look out onto the city by the end of the 1880s
- A New Palace
  - build for the emperor
  - founded as a castle town (with shogun's castle at the center of the city), but the main tower
    burned down so it lost its prominence
  - when the emperor moved to Tokyo, he moved into the old daimyo's palace, which was burned down in
    1873
  - in the early 1880s, people like Fukuzawa Yukichi began to argue that the emperor
    should have a new palace, suitable for the westernizing monarch
    - work began in 1884, and was completed in 1888, just in time for the promulgation of the Meiji
      constitution
  - new palace was intended to serve as a focal point
  - in addition to the buildings, a new plaza was created outside the palance to allow for crowds to
    celebrate ceremonies and occasions on the footsteps of the emperor
  - has a strong western (particularly German) influence
  - Rokumeikan "Deer Cry Pavillion"
    - intended to be a place where men and women could meet for grand social occasions
    - basically a large ballroom/party house
    - brainchild of Inoue Kaoru

#### 2. **Architecture and Diplomacy: Treaty Revision and the Rokumeikan**

- Inoue Kaoru as Foreign Minister
  - from Choshu, send abroad to study
  - as foreign minister in the 1880s, he was responsible for negotiating the revision of the
    treaties
  - decides it was critical to have a location where westerners could socialize with elite Japanese
    and get a sense at how the Japanese had progressed
- Rokumeikan Diplomacy and its Perception
  - couples could dance in a western style
  - this did not always work as well as hoped; Japanese were still seen as backward by westerners
  - for a time, Inoue's plan seemed to be working

#### 3. **Mixing Things Up**

- The Plan for “mixed courts” and its Failure
  - foreign merchants + business people were forced to rely on Japanese middlemen to get access to
    the interior of the country; as such, westerners were interested in opening up the middle of the
    county without having to give up their other privileges
  - after 6 years of tough negotions, in 1866, Inoue was able to get the western powers to give up
    their extraterritorial rights in Japan, the entire country was opened up to foreigners, and they
    would gain access to Japanese merchants in the interior; in return, Japan would create new, mixed
    courts to have primary jurisdiction on any case involving a foreigner
    - Japanese judges sitting alongside foreign judges; idea was developed by the British in Egypt
    - but as soon as word starts to spread that this was being considered, many people come out in
      opposition
      - one was Gustave Emile Boissonade, who was a French legal advisor to the Japanese government
      - once you let foreigners have the toehold in the legal system, it would increasingly
        difficult to have it removed
      - when ordinary people get this possibility and the contents of Inuoe's plan are leaked, there
        was massive opposition
    - Inoue was then forced to pause talks with the west and resign from his position
- Okuma Shigenobu becomes new Foreign minister
  - opens up new round of treaty negotiations in 1888
  - removes more objectionable parts of Inoue's plan, but still wants to explore the idea of mixed
    courts
  - it is leaked again and there is massive opposition
  - men of spirit attempt to bomb him, but he survives, losing a leg
  - decides to step down
- Mutsu Munemitsu as Foreign Minister in 1892
  - government was under a lot of pressure from hardliners in the new Diet and from the public on
    the question of treaty revision
  - in a reversal of drive to treaty revision, the public were convinced that the existing treaty
    port system was not that bad of a deal, as it was restricting the foreigners to the small parts of
    land
- Public anxiety about “mixed residence” with foreigners
  - "what would happen if white people and japanese people started having children?"
  - played up by party politicians in the Diet
- Achieving Treaty Revision: Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty 1894
  - existing of pressures + outpouring of public sentiment led the Japanese government to move fast
  - uses pressures to force the western powers to drop the idea of extraterritoriality; must accept
    the reformed Japanese legal system
  - British were also keen to secure an ally in the Pacific, and british agree to a new treaty (just
    on the even of the Sino-Japanese war)
    - phased in gradually, but now was an equal treaty
