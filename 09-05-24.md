## Lecture Outline - A "Closed Country"? Tokugawa Japan and the World

### 1. The Suppression of Christianity and the Control of Immigration

- Portuguese established key base in Macua in 1517, and landed in Japan in 1542
- Arrival of foreigners was initially portrayed beautifully
- Remember, Oda Nabunaga went after the traditional regligious ministries in Japan, but perhaps b/c
  the benefit of the trade, he is quite tolerant of the Christian missionaries
- Hideyoshi was also quite tolerant, but eventually becomes shocked at how successful the Jesuits
  are at winning converts and also that the Portuguese brought enslaved people with them
  - They also take some Japanese as slaves
  - Really bothers Hideyoshi
- Issues soft ban on Christianity (Catholicism) in 1587
  - increasing trend on the persecution of Christians
  - flamed by the arrival of English and the Dutch (Protestants, not Catholic)
- In 1592, 55 Catholics are matyred in Japan
- Point of no return: Shimabara Rebellion - 1637
  - Massive peasant uprising by people responsible for growing food
  - Takes place in southern Kyushu, famous for the Catholics to have converted Japanese
  - Peasants resist the power of the Tokugawa state + its allies. Their fanatacism is not a good
    thing, from the point of the Tokugawa.
  - Leads the Bakafu to come to beleive that their needs to be a 0-tolerance policy for any
    religious ideas that threaten their own authority by appealing to a higher-authority
  - Leads to ban in 1639 of all Christianity + contact with Christian missionaries
- When a Portuguese ship arrives in 1640, Tokugawa put every single Portuguese sailors to death and
  sent the Chinese back to Macua to tell their story
- Makes strong waves in the West, viewing the Japanese as a backwards culture
- Lead to ban (with threat of death) on Japanese traveling abroad, closing off the country from the
  rest of the world

### 2. An "insular" Tokugawa period?

- rise of Tokugawa lead to the rise of a powerful central authority, with control of foreign
  relations
- ability to control waters/establish strict control is key to their legitimacy of ruling
- Ban of religion can be greater attributed to execution of a strong government, rather than xenophobia, etc

### 3. Relations with the World?

- Dutch were able to stay and continue trading in Japan, even after the ban of the Portuguese
  - English withdraw b/c its not profitable
  - Establish medium-sized port in Nagasaki (southern port city in Japan)
  - Dutch often complained they lived like prisoners, but there is evidence they lived moderately
    well
- Tokugawa were very concerned with their immediate neighbords, rather than the Europeans from far
- Korean ambassador paid respects to shogun in Kyoto
  - unrelated, but there is evidence that many of the slaves taken from Japan were actually Korean
- Foreign interactions to Korea had Japanese-go-betweens, with the Lords of Satsuma and Tsushima
- Embassies were big spectacles, which helps solidify the legitimacy of the Tokugawa
- read about the Ryukyus
- Many Japanes trained in the basic Chinese tenants
- Significant trade between China and Japan (most happened in Nagasaki)
  - significant smuggling as well
- Japan did not want to be a Chinese tributary state, especially so after the Ming dynasty was
  toppled. Did not want to have relations with their successor, the Qing dynasty - Leads to disintegration of formal ties - Helps strengthen their view of belonging to a seperate cultural sphere

### 4. Intellectual Developments in the Eighteenth Century

- "National Studies", Nativism (_Kokugaku_)
  - main impulse behind was to recover the original roots of native Japanese culture from before
    the arrival of continental influences
- "Dutch Studies" (_Rangaku_)
  - Developed from the middle of the 18th century
  - Effectively, a window into the intellectual world of the West
  - Began when the ban of Chinese books about the west is lifted
    - Due to a need for a new calendar system in Japan
  - Lead to steady growth in math, medicine, etc
    - In 1770s, group of scholars (basically doctors) get ahold Dutch Medical texts, marking
      beginning of the interest in Western intellectualism
    - Leads to bitter disputes between the Chinese, Tokugawa, and Dutch-studies practitioners

### 5. Making a "Closed Country"

- The case of Baron Moritz Aladar von Benyowsky
  - Russians sent him to Kamchatka, (to the north of Japan)
  - Writes about his escapades in eastern asia and starts making up bigger and bigger stories
  - BSes about a future planned Russian invasion of Japan to the Japanese in a desperate ploy to
    get help in Kamchatka. - But this letter is send to Nagasaki, and this false claim sends a shockwave to the
    Tokugawa authorities
  - Even though Russia didn't plan it, a series of Russian incursions from trade leads to Japan to
    rethink its national defense
- New ideas about "national defense"
