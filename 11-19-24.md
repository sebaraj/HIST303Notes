# Lecture 21 - November 19, 2024 - The Sino-Japanese War and the Triple Intervention

### Lecture Outline

#### I. **The end of “Civilization and Enlightenment”**

- Increasing government restrictions on political association
  - women were not allowed to join political associations
    - essentially repressed and did not have the rights they previously had in the political realm
- The _“Imperial Rescript on Education,” 1890_
  - distributed to schools and schools were required to display a copy of this and the emperor's
    portrait for all students to see
  - a lot of emphasis that people were tied to the emperor and it was their duty to restore the
    Japanese empire
  - but this was not automatic; given the right circumstances, people in Japan could be just as
    rebelious as people across the world
- Rivalries on the Korean Peninsula

#### II. **Japan plays Perry: Treaty of Kanghwa 1876**

- remember that goals for Japanese expansion into Korea had started in the late Tokugawa period,
  and the idea that Japan needed to put the Koreans in their place in the early Meiji period leads
  to the first great splits in the Meiji oligarchs
- not long after the split, the Meiji oligarchs decide to send Japanese gunboats to Korea to force
  them to sign a peace/trade treaty in 1876 (Kanghwa Treaty)
- Japan starts moving troops into Korea, and the Chinese decide to do the same thing
- remember the failed coup attempt in 1884; supported by Japanese intellectuals and politicians,
  like Fukuzawa Yukichi; turns out to be a disaster and is crushed after 3 days
- leads to heightened tensions between Japan vs Korea/China
- 1885 - China and Japan agree to withdraw troops and deescalate the situation, but Korean court
  looks increasingly to the China (Qing) for support, while Japan starts to form a stronger economic
  foothold in Korea (prices of food start to increase; general sense of turmoil in Korea and in
  the political realm, which helps feed the popularity of the new religious, Tonghak/Donghak
  Rebellion in 1894)
  - aggressive campaign against the oppression of Koreans by the Joseon dynasty and the presense of
    foreigners in Korea
  - Korean court first sends its own troops in to quash the rebellion, but when that fails, the
    Joseon court turns to the Qing dynasty for help/troops
  - China uses this to make a power play, but the Japanese saw that as an excuse to send their
    own troops into Korea to "free them from the Chinese"
  - Korean troops go underground after hearing that both Chinese and Japanese troops were coming
    to the Korea
  - negotiations between Japan and China but the Japanese proposals are shot down by the Qing
    dynasty, leading to a breakdown of negotiations
  - By the end of 1884, Meiji Japan convinced British support against China in the event that
    anything happens in Korea
  - one week later, they seize the Joseon court and force the Korean court to "ask" the Japanese for help and to send troops
    to defend Korea against China

#### III. **The Sino-Japanese War and its Reportage in Japan**

- Li Hung-Chang (Hongzhang) takes control of the Chinese forces, and on the battlefield, the
  Japanese quickly show their superiority since htey had a decade to prepare
- The Outbreak of War with China, July 1894
  - A String of Japanese Victories:
    - Pyong-yang
    - Yellow Sea
    - Liaotung Peninsula (dramatic move as was directly in China's mainland; fighting was fierce,
      but Hapanese get control)
    - Weihaiwei (another Chinese port in the Yellow Sea)
  - Also decide that the next step is to seize Taiwan, which was a Chinese territory
- People in Japan that were making newspapers and art about their powerful military and how exciting
  it was
  - Kobayashi Koyochika, a famous woodblock artist, made a lot of prints about the war
    - [artwork](https://visualizingcultures.mit.edu/kiyochika_tokyo/ki_essay01.html)

#### IV. **The Art of War: Kobayashi Kiyochika and his Wartime Prints**

- Peace Negotiations and the Triple Intervention
  - negotiations open in Shimonoseki, Japan
  - Qing is represented by Li Hung-Chang, who is a very experienced diplomat and Japan is represented
    by Ito Hirobumi
  - soon after they opened, a nationalist in Japan kills Li Hung-Chang on Japanese soil
  - Japanese offer to immediately suspend hostilities
    - 1. China will now officially recognize Korea's independence
    - 2. Qing agree to ceed Taiwan (and Pescadores Islands) to Japan
    - 3. China will ceed Port Arthur to the Japanese
    - 4. Qing will pay 300 million yen as reperations to the Meiji government for damages
    - 5. Qing will give Japan the same privileges that the Western powers have in China, i.e. an
         unequal treaty
- Japanese Reaction to Victory: The Case of Tokutomi Sohō
  - one of Japan's most important journalist
  - before the time of the Sino-Japanese war, he was an active memory of the People's Rights
    movement
  - In 1894, he is already writing "The defeat of China marks a new epoch in Japanese history... It
    brings the nation in one leap from a antional existence to a world ecistence"
  - "Regarding us as savages who have suffedly imitated civilization, [Westerners] are only
    impressed by our skill in imitating. But now, we are no longer ashamaed to stand before the world
    as Japanese. [Now the Westerners know] that civilization is not a monopoly of the white man."
- The Triple Intervention: From Jubilation to Anguish
  - A week after signing the treaty, the Japanese receive news that an alliance between Germany,
    Russia, and France tell them to ceed the gained land and stop Japanese expansion into China/that
    area, so Russia can try to be the dominant power in the region
  - [triple intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Intervention)
  - leads to national (racial) humiliation in Japan, and the Japanese people not rally to the
    government's side and their desire for war has been created
  - Soho declares that a stronger military/wars are needed b/c nobody is going to respect Japan
    unless they have a strong military
  - leads to a 10 year plan to be able to beat either Britain or France+Russia in a war
    - plan to use the reparation payment from China to pay for this + jumpstart an industrial
      revolution in Japan
  - domination of Japanese in markets in Korea helps fuel expansion and growth; and there is some
    ambivalence/disallusionment by Japan about the West
  - in the west, there was the notion of a "yellow peril" that the Japanese were going to take over
    the world, using the brute force of the population of Asia to take over the west
- the entire society becomes obssessed with the military; holding military funerals; giving children
  guns/toy soldiers; teaching them in schools, etc
- The Emperor and the War

### Imperial Rescript on Education (October 30, 1890)

Know ye, Our subjects: Our Imperial Ancestors have founded Our Empire on a basis broad and
everlasting and have deeply and firmly implanted virtue; Our subjects ever united in loyalty and
filial piety have from generation to generation illustrated the beauty thereof. This is the glory of
the fundamental character of Our Empire, and herein also lies the source of our education. Ye, Our
subjects, be filial to your parents, affectionate to your brothers and sisters, as husbands and
wives be harmonious, as friends true; bear yourselves in modesty and moderation; extend your
benevolence to all; pursue learning and cultivate arts, and thereby develop intellectual faculties
and perfect moral powers; furthermore advance public good and promote common interests; always
respect the Constitution and observe the laws; should emergency arise, offer yourselves courageously
to the State; and thus guard and maintain the prosperity of Our Imperial Throne coeval with heaven
and earth. So shall ye not only be our good and faithful subjects, but render illustrious the best
traditions of your forefathers.

The Way here set forth is indeed the teaching bequeathed by Our Imperial Ancestors, to be observed
alike by Their Descendants and the subjects, infallible for all ages and true in all places. It is
Our wish to lay it to heart in all reverence, in common with you, Our subjects, that we may thus
attain to the same virtue.

The 30th day of the 10th month of the 23rd year of Meiji (October 30, 1890). (Imperial Sign Manual.

### Japan Weekly Mail (June 1, 1895)

Never did Tokyo wear a gayer appearance and never were all classes more thoroughly represented in
the vast crowd that surged through the streets than on Thursday, when His Majesty the Emperor, so
long absent from his Imperial city, returned to the metropolis, crowned with the laurels of a
victorious war. No matter how great the friction between political parties and the Cabinet, no
matter how deep-seated the dissatisfaction on account of the inevitable retrocession of Manchuria
(Liaotung Peninsula) all hearts have ever shown unswerving loyalty and prompt obedience to the
Emperor’s will. His Majesty’s indefatigable labors, frugality, and actual discomfort while at
Hiroshima, for so many months the Head-Quarters have created a profound impression on the hearts of
the people, with whom “fidelity to the Imperial House” has ever proved a watchword potent to still
all storms. The kindly interest expressed in the welfare of those engaged in the war, the frequent
visits to Hospitals and the sick and wounded, the numerous imperial donations of little comforts and
luxuries that mean so much to soldier or sailor far from his native land—all these things will
remain indelibly impressed on the memory of the present generation and be the boast and pride of its
descendants…
