## Lecture Outline - Reforms and Rebellions

### 1. The Side-Effects of Peace and the Kyōhō Reforms

- The financial costs of peace
- Peace and the growth of these financial cites that formed as a result in the 17th century led to
  samurai poverty
- Problem for samurai, daimyo, and the Bakufu
- Lead to borrowing money from merchants
- Beginning in 1720s, Bakufu (Tokugawa) announced that they could not pay their samurai
- In an attempt to remedy, TOKUGAWA Yoshimune’s push to rebuild the tax base by launching a series
  of reforms, called the Kyōhō Reforms
- early stages: do whatever was necessary to restore Bakafu's finances
- By forking over more money, Daimyo's recognized that they were able to get away with worse
  'alternate attendance' (sankin-kōtai)
- Under Yoshimune, they promoted more frugality among the samurai. Trying to restore the 'spartan'
  warrior spirit (also a moral/behavior reform)
- Tightens up its system of tax collection (remember it was paid in rice), lead to peasant resistance
- But it worked pretty well, and in 1728, they were able to restore the alternate attendance
  requirements
- Later in the 1730s, Bakufu meets new opposition, greatly intensified by the famine of 1732, Kyoho
  famine. Scholars thought that the famine was due to an ecological limit to the population
- By the beginning of 1733, rice prices skyrocketed, created conditions where uprisings occured
  throughout the country
- Yoshimune start to explore other approaches to improve the economy
- Starts to build closer relationoships with merchants and encourages the cultivation of more
  diverse crops, like sugar cane and sweet potatoes
- These reforms succeed in restoring the economy/bakufu finances back to health
- Yoshimune also codifies all of the laws put in place by the Tokugawa Bakufu in the first half of
  their reign
- But, growing sense of inequality/corruption, reaching peak in 1760s and 1770s when the Bakufu
  was dominated by TANUMA Okitsugu

### 2. The Rise and Fall of TANUMA Okitsugu

- Tanuma came from humble origins, rising to become very powerful
- Gets a start as a low ranking page, but builds a friendship with the shogun and other powerful men (had sexual
  relationships?)
- Was able to completely dominate the Bakufu, taking Yoshimune's policies to a new extreme
- described as a forerunner of modern Japan, based on his economic policies
- But in 1780s, a series of disasterous croup failures hit eastern Japan, leading to a massive spike
  on rice prices
- Causes extreme social distress/hardship. ~100,000 people starved to death
- Death of Tanuma's main patron, Tokugawa Ieharu, in 1786, was enough to shake his reigns on the
  bakafu. many of the daimyo now move against him
- In first half of 1787 when Tanuma still has power, there is a rapidly growing divide in the Bakufu
  between the Tanuma-loyal faction and the daimyo faction
  - Stalemate is broken by "ordinary people", when uprisings sweep through ~30 towns/cities
  - Most serious was in Edo, for 5 days/nights, 1000s of people from the lower level of society
    tearing rice stores to the ground. Known as the "smashings" (_uchi kowashi_)
  - Main target of this anger was not Tanuma/authorities, but the merchants who were hoarding
    rice
  - Mark the beginning of Yonaoshi (Millenarian world-renewal) movements
- Tanuma is called onto resign and is replaced by MATSUDAIRA Sadanobu, the leader of the daimyo
  group

### 3. MATSUDAIRA Sadanobu and the Kansei Reforms

- People were drawn to him b/c of his reputation for skillful governance during the height of the
  famine years, especially given that his domain was one of the hardest hit
- Unlike Tanuma, Sadanobu had an impeccable samurai pedigree/lineage, being the grandson of the 8th
  shogun, Yoshimune
- Smashings were put down by a Bakufu militia.
- Once in power, he immediately sets out to consolatidate his position as the advisor to the shogun,
  Tokugawa Ienari
- Over the 18th century, we see the shift of the real power of the bakufu shifting from the shogun
  himself to the people around him/his advisors
- Afterwards, tries to follow in Yoshimune's footsteps, launching a new series of reforms, called the
  Kansei Reforms, curbing samurai expenditure, by drastic options such as canceling debts over 20
  years old
- Protecting the peasantry, by taking people who moved into cities/fell into poverty and resettling
  them only land that they could farm, reducing the number of people reliant on urban markets for
  sustenance
- Implements various policies to protect Edo in rice markets, ultimately to prevent a similar
  uprising that happened earlier and got him into power
  - Forces rice merchants into a cooperative financial venture with the Bakafu, acting as a central bank and regulating rice prices
- Sadanobu's reforms were successful, but was not able to maintain them, as he was forced to resign
  in 1793 due to dispute between the Bakufu and the Emperor's court in Kyoto, known as "The Title
  Incident".

  - Starts when the Emperor Kōkaku, decides he want his father to be honored with the title of
    "Retired Emperor"
    - But emperor's father had never actually been emperor and this move would've broken all
      precedencts established by the Bakufu
    - For the first time since the founding of the Bakufu, the Emperor's court in Kyoto was able to
      assert its authority over the Bakufu, and defy the Bakufu's authority
    - Sadanobu issues an official decree, and finds ways to punish those who he thinks are behind
      this
    - But, the Emperor's court in Kyoto is able to get the support of the daimyo, and Sadanobu is
      forced to resign (within 4 months of the incident)
    - Serves as a rallying cry for those that thought the Bakufu was disrespectful to the Imperial
      Court - Source of this sentiment was the Mito School (in the Mito domain) - One of the representative scholars of the school was AIZAWA Seishisai - Mito Domain was one of the "Three Houses" of the Tokugawa Family, being very closely
      related to the main house - In pushing for the veneration of the imperial court, they were really trying to bolster
      the legitimacy of the Tokugawa Bakufu ('critics' from within)

- Last for 3 decades until 1930s, when the Bakufu is dominated by Tokugawa Ienari

### 4. TOKUGAWA Ienari and the Status Quo

- Ienari was the 11th shogun, and was only 14 when he took power, reigning for half a century
- Had > 40 wives/concubines, and > 50 children
- Allowed him to consolidate his power, by marrying into the most powerful families in Japan, and
  adopting their children
- Makes the shogun's harem, o-oku, a powerful political force
- Bolster's the regime's stability, but hampers their ability to respond to problems, becoming
  engulfed in a false sense of security
  - Some were able to see the writing on the wall: AIZAWA Seishisai
