# Lecture 15 - October 29, 2024 - "Chastise Korea!" - The Split of 1873 and its Aftermath

## Lecture Outline

#### 1. **Relations with Korea after the Restoration**

- recall the bakufu maintaining diplomatic relationship with Korea (Korean Embassy in Edo)

  - but not direct; mediated through Tsushima domain
  - Tsushima domain and the problem of the term "Emperor"
  - when the bakufu fell, Korea was attempted to be notified of the emperor's restoration by Tsushima domain, but
    the Tsushima domain don't tell the Korean king/refuse to accept it
    - were against the use of the chinese word emperor for description of the emperor, as emperor >
      king, and traditionally, only China had an emperor, and the surounding countries had kings
    - very different from situation during the Tokugawa period
    - Korea used word Taikun for the shogun (prince), and the bakufu used the word king for the Korean king
  - in the late Tokugawa period, many writers started talking about Korea in negative terms
    - nativist scholars pointed to passages that interpreted Korea as a previous colony of the
      Japanese emperor
    - leads members of the Mito school and some nativists to argue that Japan should once again
      conquer Korea

- Early plans for aggression
  - Some leaders, like daimyo of Satsuma, were worried about Russia and valued Korea as a buffer
    from the Russians
  - from the perspective of the Japanese leaders, Korea's reluctance to acknowledge the emperor's
    restoration was a sign of disrespect
  - mission sent to investigate what would be required to conquer Korea
    - nothing comes of this though, as the Meiji leaders choose to focus on negotiating a new
      relationship with the Qing dynasty in China
      - signing of a Western-style treaty with China
      - first time two east asian countries agree to see themselves as equals
  - thought this would help Korea recognize the emperor's restoration
    - but Korea doesn't see it that way
    - declares Japan as a rogue state/renegade country (sign in Busan)

#### 2. **The "caretaker" government**

- Remember many of the great heros/leaders of the Meiji Restoration, leading Saigo Takamori in
  charge of the government
- some see it as a way to make a name for themselves
- Opportunity and ambition: The case of Etō Shimpei
  - Saga domain
  - a loyalist/activist of the Meiji restoration
  - eventually rises to become First Minister of Justice in 1872
  - remember, the west refused to allowed their citizens/white men to be prosecuted by Japanese
    government until Japan had a "fair", western-style legal system
  - finds himself in a critically important role, creating an independent judiciary, and invites
    western experts to advise the government on how to go about creating western-style criminal and
    civil codes
  - builds up his own power base, and starts to make a name for himself, ultimately being promoted
    to "councilor of state" (daijōkan) (highest role that could be given in the government)
- Other reforms
  - Saigo embraces he need for a modern banking system
- Responding to the Korea problem
  - when faced with the sign/situation in Korea where Japan is labeled as a rogue government
  - One of the people that takes the leader is Itagaki Taisuke (1837-1919)
    - important leader from Tosa, being an important military leader in the Meiji restoration
    - proponent of "Chastise Korea" (Seikanron)
    - wins over considerable support from the caretaker government
  - Itagaki Taisuke v. Saigo Takamori
    - but Saigo is more cautious and convinces the government to take a more diplomatic
      approach, sending Saigo himself as a high-ranking envoy
    - but decide to wait until the Iwakura mission returns before sending Saigo
      - return by the Fall of 1873

#### 3. **Return of the Iwakura Mission and the Split of 1873**

- Caretaker government v. mission members
  - Ikakura, Okubo, and Kido are all opposed to sending Saigo, with the traditional view being
    that Saigo's goal was not to negotiate in good faith, but to provoke the Koreans and get himself
    killed, so that there would be a clear reason to attack
    - did not want Japan to risk itself from any risky overseas adventures
    - wanted to focus on domestic reforms
- Okubu and Kido in the past, had been just as willing to use military force against Korea
  - Kido was previously very hawkish against Korea
  - Okubu wanted to send gunship to Korea to force them to sign a treaty, just like the US did to
    Japan in Edo (Commodore Perry)
- Different interpretations of "the split"
  - but in the end, the major difference between these groups was not whether or not to attack
    Korea, but when
  - lead to a major split in the Meiji leadership
  - caretakers follow Saigo in resigning from the government in protest of the mission members
    refusing to attack Korea
- paved the way for Okubo to truly dominate policy
  - Kido Koin suffered from bad health and was unable to engage in the government
- many people lose faith in the government, perceiving Okubo's actions as westernizing for the sake
  of westernizing, and not for the sake of Japan/samurai
  - Meiji regime starts to be accused of Tyranny and despotism

#### 4. **The aftermath**

- Rising tide of samurai discontent

  - Etō and the Saga rebellion 1874
    - Saga/Hizen domain (southwest of the main islands) was important during the Meiji Restoration
    - home domain of Eto Shimpei
    - Eto is soon convinced by the rebels to sign on, but is cast as a traitor to the emperor
    - the rebellion is quickly put down, and Eto is executed/his head is put on public display
  - Saigo decides to establish system of schools in Satsuma
    - but in 1876, the government launches series of new policies that samurai groups see as
      betrayal
      - e.g. banning of samurai swords from being carried in public
      - phase out hereditary stipends for samurai
  - More rebellions (Kumamoto, Akitsuki, Hagi 1876)
    - all these are in the southwest of Japan (heartland of the restoration)
    - all were put down easily
  - Saigo and the Satsuma rebellion 1877
    - rebellion in Kagoshima, capital of Satsuma
    - "War of the Southwest"
    - triggered when the Meiji government moves the arsenal of weapons out of Kagoshima to another
      city. samurai saw this as a precursor to the government disarming them
    - many people form Saigo's school and spread rumors that Okubo was sending assassins to kill
      Saigo
    - convinces Saigo to take leadership of this rebellion (had more than 30,000 highly motivated
      soldiers)
    - government forces were able to defeat Saigo's forces, and Saigo is killed on the battlefield,
      marking the end of the Satsuma rebellion
    - Saigo's death quickly takes on hero status, seen as a martyr for the samurai cause

- but people now accept that armed rebellion is not the way to cause change (b/c Saigo was such a
  strong leader/commander)
- Another approach - more of an embrace of a need for a popularly elected assembly/parliament and
  political parties
  - In 1881, Itagaki founds Japan's liberal party (Jiyū-tō)
  - Itagaki Taisuke and the "Movement for Freedom and Popular Rights"
    - went around Japan trying to convince people for the need of a parliament
- none of the great leaders of the Meiji Restoration saw this parliament: the death of Ōkubo 1878
  - was attacked by samurai and killed in Tokyo
  - attackers called Okubo a traitor to the samurai/traditional values embodied by Saigo
