## Lecture Outline

#### 1. Studying the West

- Dutch studies had been an establish area of scholarship, so that is where many interested in the
  studying the West turned
- The case of FUKUZAWA Yukichi
  - on 10,000 yen note for a long time.
  - household name; often pointed to as a personification of the best aspects of the Meiji period

  - his family decides for him to go to Nagasaki to study Dutch and learn about Western gunnery
  - starts learning the Western alphabet, and then starts learning English, but after ~year, he
    decides to move to Osaka
    - why Osaka? Ogata Koan, a physician, who had been studying Western medicine. This lead Ogata to
      establish a school in Osaka, called the Tekijuku Academy, which Fukuzawa attends
      - relatively simple building, with one large room and only one Dutch-Japanese Dictionary that
        they were constantly fighting over
      - simply being at the Tekijuku was more than enough for making you a target for an attack by
        the expel the barbarian type samurai
      - but his knowledge + ambition, he gets an order from his home domain (Nakatsu) to go to Edo
        to establish a new school to teach samurai from Nakatsu about western science
      - arrivs in Edo during the Keio era
      - writes in his diary that no one understood what he was saying in Dutch and that he was not
        able to read the various signboards. efforts to learn Dutch had gone for nothing
  - eventually established Keio Univesity
  - decides to learn English, and in 1860s takes a voyage to the US to help the bakufu ratify the
    Harris treaty

    Conditions in the West (1866), talking about literally everything he saw. sold around 250,000
    copies, making it the most widely read book in the East-West period

  - born in Satsuma and went to study in Britain during the final years of the restoration period
  - returns to Japan and establishes in 1873 the Meiji 6 society (Meirokusha), which was a group of
    debating society that was dedicated to the study of Western thought
    - published a journal called Meiroku zasshi about their debates, giving a sense of how people
      were grappling with the ideas of the West
    - first place where people called for the abolition of judicial torture, etc, and also if Japan
      should establish a popularly elected parliament
  - many of the people involved in the Meirokusha were actually people backed by the Bakugu (when it
    was in power)/on the losing side of the transition to the Meiji government
- The case of YAMAKAWA Kenjirō—Yale’s first Japanese graduate
  - from Aizu domain (remember how it was singled out from the rest of the domains by Satsuma and
    Choshu)
  - goes to America to study, (Yale in 1871, graduated Yale College (SSS) in 1875 in Physics) and
    goes back to University and becomes an important professor and established many important
    universities and becomes an important advisor to the emperor

#### 2. Treaty Revision and the Iwakura Mission

- From “Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarian” to “Review the Treaties” (in the 1870s and 1880s)
  - Idea about learning about western military strength is important, but increasingly, the Meiji
    leaders were not worried about a western invasion, but start to realize that the biggest threat
    was permanent relagation to a second-class nation state
  - all these heirarchies of domains/people
  - Japanese leaders recognize that one of the things that limits them to this second-class status is
    the "unequal treaties"
    - signaled that Japan was at best a semi-civilized country
  - it was a critical mission to revise these unequal treaties
- 1869 - sends a letter to the various treaty members to renegotiate the treaties
- 1871 IWAKURA Tomomi leads a mission of leaders to the West
  - both Okubo Toshimichi and Kido Koin were part of the mission (including 50 others)
  - away for 18 months
  - intent was to show how civilized the Japanese people were and that were worthy of respect
  - wear all Western clothes; eat Western food; etc.
- SAIGŌ Takamori and the “caretaker government”
  - Saigo does not go on this mission and is left in charge of the government while everyone else is
    away
  - agreement is made that no new policies/decisions will be made while the mission is away
- Women and the Iwakura Mission
  - sent a group of Japanese girls abroad to study (intended to impress the West)
  - YAMAKAWA Sutematsu (sister of Yamakawa Kenjiro) comes to New Haven, CT,
  - pastor of Central Church on the green, Leonard Bacon, and his daughter, Alice Mabel Bacon (1858-1919), take her
    in and teach her English
    - become lifelong friends and goes back to Japan with them and teaches in a Japanese school
  - Nagai Shige and Sutematsu Yamakawa study at Vassar College, and then go back to Japan where
    Sutematsu is married off to a high-ranking samurai
  - TSUDA Ume (1864-1929) goes to America and studies at Bryn Mawr College, and then goes back to
    Japan and refuses to marry, devoting herself to founding a college for women, Tsuda College
- Ultimately, the mission was a failure, as many countries were not interested in revising the
  treaties

#### 3. The era of “Civilization and Enlightenment”

- industry was often thought as creating unnecessary luxury, but during their travels, they see that
  in order to create a powerful military, you needed to have a powerful industry and needed to
  embrace commerce
- you can actually create a school system to provide universal education for both boys and girls
- also come to realize that the immediate thread posed by the west was not as acute as they thought,
  and had time for long range planning and careful management
- increasingly embrace the idea of gradualism (gradual, thoguhtful change)
- becomes convinced that the west must become the model
- when they returned, they found that the government in a different state, leading to a split in the
  government after their return
