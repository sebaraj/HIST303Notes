## Lecture Outline - "Troubles at Home", The Crisis of the Tempo Period

### 1. From boom to bust...

- TOKUGAWA Ienari (11th shogun, ruled frtom 1787 to 1837), who rule was marked by the Kasei period (1804-1830)
  - Associated with the idea of maturating of society in the Archipelago
- Edo period merchant hourses (like Mitsui) had a great impact on economy then and continue to do so
  now
  - Very conscious of thei Edo period roots
- Urban Prosperity and commerce – Kidai Shōran (scroll, ca. 1804. depicts the bustling prosperity of the
  commerce at the time)
  - Focused on common people, not just the elite
- Printing culture starting to take off, allowing the flow of knowledge
  - Facilitated by institutions like Lending Libraries (kashi hon-ya)
- The Tempō period (1830-1844) – a time of crisis
  - Almost immediately signs of trouble for the samurai class
  - Okagemairi – “Thanksgiving Pilgrimages” to the Ise Shrine
    - Commoners start ditching their obligations to go on these pilgrimages
    - Not new to 1830. something along these lines happened every 60 years
      - But this pilgrimage was of an unprecedented scale (estimates around 5 million out of
        30 million people participated)
    - The Bakufu was concerned, as the scale suggests there may be an impending breakdown of
      authority in the rural parts
- In 1833-1836, there are unusually cold temperatures and crop failures
  - Another outbreak of famine and facilitates a rising tide of unrest
  - Think of a relay of the 1780s, but on a larger scale
- The bakufu were able to keep rebellions down in Edo (due to MATSUDAIRA Sadanobu policies
  prioritizing Edo's rice/food supply during a famine), but Osaka (in the West) was where many of the
  rice tax stores were - Rice was being taken out of Osaka and sent to Edo - Infuriantig to the people of Osaka

### 2. The Rebellion of ŌSHIO Heihachirō, 1837

- Rebellion in Osaka – Circulation of a manifesto

- Uprising being led by samurai official send shockwaves through the upper echelons of the warrior
  class - Did not help that Oshio sought to harness populist/ordinary townfolk to rise up and join his
  revolt
- In this manifesto, "We must first punish the officials, who torment th epeople so cruelly, then we
  must execute the haught and rise Osaka merchants. Then we must distribute the gold, silver and
  copper stores in their cellars, and the bales of rice hidden in their storehouses." - Appealing to the inequality/suffering of the ordinary people
- Rebellion was not terribly successful. They set fires/burned down 1/4 of Osaka, but when all was
  set and done, the Bakufu forces were able to quash the revolt in half a day.

- But rebellion was important, seeking to harness the townfolk to bring reforms

  - General sense of disgust at official corruption and indifference
  - His ideas linger and continue to have an impact, having a potent legacy for decades that
    follow

- Oshio:

  - Student of WANG Yang-ming (Ming dynasty China)
    - Critic of Orthodox Neo-Confucianism and stresses the importance of action
    - Previously intepreted action as personal conduct, but Oshio radicalizes this to mean action in
      the public realm
  - Sees the Emperor as defender of justice and benevolence for common
    people. Argued that was ultimately important was not loyalty to the shogun, but loyalty to
    fighting for justice, and it was the emperor who represents the transcendent moral order
    - uses this to justify his rebellion
    - Reflects the growing importance of the emperor in the political domain

### 3. Official responses to the Tempō Crisis

- Crisis was not followed by any systemic reform program
  - Tokugawa Ienari was still shogun, officially steps down in 1837 but remains the powerhouse in
    the Bakufu until his death in 1841
    - Since he is happy with the status quo, he seems no need to launch drastic reforms
- However, there were some daimyo who were concerned about the crisis
  - TOKUGAWA Nariaki (1800-1860) – Daimyo of Mito Domain
    - One of the three branch families of the main Tokugawa house
    - Concerned about the crisis, and the need for reform
    - Advocated for a series of reforms, known as the Tempō Reforms
    - These reforms were not implemented, but they were a sign of the growing concern
- Domainal reforms – emergence of “domain nationalism”
  - most do the standard ones of canceling debts, frugality, etc
  - some domains focused on enhacing commerce and industry, setting up domain monopolies
    - Satsuma Domain was one of the most successful in this regard
  - all members of the domain working together for the common good/strength
- In 1841, momentum for set of reforms for the Bakufu builds
- MIZUNO Tadakuni (1794-1851), the daimyo of Hamamatsu domain, – a key figure in the Bakufu’s reforms
  - Advocated for a series of reforms, known as the Tempō Reforms (1841)
  - focused on moral reform, particularly in the cities
    - tried to stamp out gambling, prostitution, circus performances, etc
    - ordinary people resented this "crackdown" on urban culture
    - In 1842/43, he launches a series of reforms to bolster the Bakufu's finances and power
      - these angered many different groups in Tokugawa society, ultimately leading to his
        opposition to derail his carrer/reform program
    - In 1844, he is forced to resign (brief comeback in 1845) and the reforms are abandoned
- Some domains in the southwest were not drastically affected by the Tempo famine, and were able to
  come out much stronger than before
  - Satsuma Domain was one of the most successful in this regard
