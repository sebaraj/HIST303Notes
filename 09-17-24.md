# Lecture 6 - September 17, 2024 - "Dangers from Abroad": The Red Coats (and Yalies) are Coming!

## Lecture Outline

### 1. Samuel Wells Wlliams and the Morrison Incident

- First professor of anything east asia at any major American university
- Taught Chinese at Yale
- Thought of Aizawa Seishisai's worst nightmare
  - recall the reading
- Moved to China (Canton) in 1833 and joins group of protestant missionaries, spending next 40 years of life in China
- In 1836, Americans tried to establish new relationship with Japan by returning shipwrecked Japanese sailors
- Originally sent to Macua, but
- In 1837, thers a plan to take a ship called the Morrison to Japan, paid for by a NY businessman named Charles King, to try to return the Japanese castaways
- But Japan still has the foreign expulsion decree, so the ship is driven away the coast of Edo and
  then Satsuma, forcing the men back to China living in permanent exile
  - Use of force to repel this ship is controversial to some Japanese (Dutch scholars, etc) and
    critique some Bakufu policy

### 2. Dangers from Abroad: British Imperialist Expansion in Asia

- Remember, British were rapidly expanding in Asia at this time, and the Japanese were aware of this
  - Lead to sending large swathes of British silver being sent to China to pay for tea
  - So British solved this problem by paying for exports with opium
  - Chinese (Qing dynasty) eventually ban opium, slowly getting more serious and declare a war of
    drugs
  - In response, British declare war on China and send their Navy (Opium War)
  - Opium War establishes the basic model of how Western powers will interact with Asian countries
    (including Japan)
  - At the heart of the model, is the idea of the "Treaty Port System"
    - Treaty of Nanking (1842) is the first of these treaties
    - Chinese cede Hong Kong to British, open up 5 ports to British trade, Extraterritoriality
      (legal principle that foreigners are not subject to local laws, i.e. any British citizen that
      commited a crime in China would not be handed over to Chinese authorities, but would be tried by
      British authorities, often British merchants), and also a fixed, artifically low, tariff rate
- As soon as it is completed, other western countries show up and demand similar treaties
  - Serves as basis for Japanese treaties later
- News does not take long to reach the Bakufu
  - Happening at the same time as the Tenpo Reforms (domestic reforms)

### 3. Japan and the West, 1842-1854

- In 1842, expulsion decree is formally recinded
- In 1844, Wilhelm II, the Dutch king, warns the Bakufu that the British were coming in search of
  trade, and if Japan did not open up, they would be forced to
  - Suggested that the Japanese look to the Dutch for assistance (wanted to negotiate a new treaty)
  - At this point, also a power struggle within the Bakufu, when Abe Masahiro (1845-) becomes the
    head of the Bakufu beauracracy
  - Abe does not take up the Dutch on the offer
- But in the next few years, two Western countries show up
  - Jean-Baptiste Cecille (France) and James Biddle (US)
  - Both try to negiotiate treaties for trade, but are rebuffed
  - Biddle brings two large gunships, but both the French and Americans make no trouble (for now)
- But in Washington DC, politicians were growing increasingly unhappy with Japan
  - Note the Gold rush (1849), the Mexican American war (1846-1848) and how California became part
    of the US, and the British selling the US Oregon
  - Burgeoning population on the West Coast, leading to talk of a trans-continental railroad, so why
    not go all the way to Asia?
- Moby Dick (starts in New Bedford). New Bedford/Nantucket is the whaling capital of the US/world.
- In 1848, 15 American whalers from the Lagoda, get shipwrecked in Ezo, and are then taken to
  Nagasaki, who send word to the Americans
  - Leads to another Naval commander, named James Glenn, to go to rescue them
  - Forces the Japanese to finally turn over the Americans, and when they are brought back, the
    newspapers recount all of the barbarities that they suffered at the hands of the Japanese
  - President Filmore chooses Matthew Perry (Naval Commander) to go to Japan to renegotiate the
    american relationship with Japan
  - Told to use restraint, but journey helps him realize the important of the culling stations
    independent of the British
  - Uses Samuel Wells Williams as an interpreter
  - Perry ends up sailing his ships right into Edo Bay, and threatens the Japanese, leaving Abe
    Masahiro with a dilemna
    - If he rejects the American proposal, Japan might be forced into war
    - But if he accepts those demands, he opens up the Bakufu to serious criticize
    - Abe decides to do something unprecendented: asks all the Daimyo for their opinion
      - signifies beginning of the end of Bakufu's exclusive authority
      - no agreement on the right course of action
- Perry returns in 1854, and by end of March, a treaty had been signed
