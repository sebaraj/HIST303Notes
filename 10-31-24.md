# Lecture 16 - October 31, 2024 - Political Opposition and Economic “Shock Therapy”

## Lecture Outline

#### 1. The Satsuma Rebellion and the economy

- Japan as an economic backwater?
  - The Japan Gazaette, 1882: called Japanese people lazy and unproductive. called out banking
    systemas inefficient and corrupt
  - remember, Japan was mainly agraian up until this point
  - most manufacturing was done in the cottage industry, like sake brewing, etc
  - successful implementation of land tax reform to raise money (in cash), but despite of that, the Meiji government's
    finances was a mess (due to Satsuma rebellion)
    - takes entire conscripted army, police force, and 10,000 recruits by Saigo to put this down
  - government's initial response was to print more money
    - the issued bank notes were inconvertable (i.e. the value of the money was not guaranteed)
    - the amount of gold/silver that the government owned was only 6% of the amount of money in
      circulation, leading to serious inflation
      - price of rice doubled in just 2 years, and prices across the board increased by ~64%
  - minister of finance, Okuma Shigenobu (1838-1922), creates a plan to fix the problem in 1880
    - thinks solution is to borrow money, specifically from the western powers (Britain)
    - used borrowed money to buy up inconvertable notes and replace the with modern, convertible
      notes, guaranteed by the central bank
    - but this plan was never implemented, as he became embroiled in a controversy
      - recall Okubo Toshimichi's assassination in 1878 and the other leaders' deaths, leaving a
        power vacuum
        - this was filled by Okuma, who appoints his followers to key positions within the
          bureaucracy
      - but the issue was that Okubo was from Saga (not Choshu), and is not trusted by the next
        generation of leaders from Satsuma and Choshu
  - recall Itagaki Taisuke (Tosa) (1837-1919) and his group, who were calling for a parliament

#### 2. The rise of the Movement for Freedom and Popular Rights

- Itagaki Taisuke and the growth of a popular opposition movement
  - significant interest in political reform
- Women and the movement
  - Kusonose Kita (1833-1920), from Tosa, and Kishida Toshiko (1863-1901), from Kyoto,
  - Kusonose's letter to the authorities, 1878
    - becomes known as Old Lady Rice within the Tosa domain
  - Kishida Toshiko was selected to serve as a lady in waiting to the empress
    - doesnt stay long, but her time there gives her respectability/authority in public
  - Kishida is asked to speak at one of the rallies originally to draw in more young men, but is
    revealed to be a powerful speaker, arguing that the true measure of any civilization was its
    treatment of women and the differences in the treatment of sexes
    - showed that Japan had an opportunity to show the world that it was a civilized (even the most
      civilizted) nation by giving women more rights than they had in the west
- Government reactions to the call for a parliament
  - petition with 100,000 signatures
  - Ōkuma and the English model
    - very enthusiastic about reform along an English model (i.e. Japan was an emperor, British
      have a monarch; wanted a constitutional monarchy)
  - Itō Hirobumi (1841-1909) and the German model
    - Ito was a core participant of the Iwakura Mission
    - he is from Choshu and pushes the idea that Okuma is dangerous
    - valued the Prussian/German model
- 1881: Another political split
  - Okuma and his followers were branded as liberals and ousted from the government
  - afterwards, Satsuma and Choshu increasingly dominate the government
  - Okuma and his followes now turned to the people to discuss this increased despotism/grasp on
    power of the Sat-Cho clique
  - many came to believe that popular representation was an essential need
- emperor issues decree that a parliament would be establish in 10 years time (deadline 1890)
  - Okuma forms the Progressive Party (_kaishin-tō_) in 1882
  - the Sat-Cho oligarches formed the conservatives (they were still in power)

#### 3. The Matsukata Deflation

- Matsukata Masayoshi as finance minister
  - disciple of Okubo Toshimichi and is quite a controversial figure
  - remembered as a far-sighted statesman who paved the way for Japan’s industrialization
  - but others view him as their arch-villian
  - decides to radically reduce spending, and to balance the books, raises taxes
  - then gradually buys up the paper money and replaces it with convertible notes, issued by a new
    central bank, the Bank of Japan
    - the first governor of the Bank of Japan, Yoshihara Shigetoshi, was the first Japanese student
      to study at Yale (in 1869), but doesn't finish his degree as he is very smart and called back
      to Japan after only a year
  - ultimately succeed in stopping the inflation, but even lead to the sharpest period of deflation
    in Japanese history
- Retrenchment and deflation
  - drops from 10 yen in 1881 to 5 yen in 1884
  - many prices dropped to pre-Satsuma rebellion prices
  - but up and down fluctuations in the economy was very tough on farmers (b/c their incomes are
    essentially halved), leading a major surge in rural poverty and indebtedness
  - about 10% of all land in the country was sold off
  - government also moved to prosecute thousands of people for not paying their taxes
  - significant rise in the number of share-croppers (tenant farmers) and landless laborers
- Military expenditure and new taxes
  - government also starts planning/spending on their military to account for a future conflict
  - military expenditure was 1/3 of the national budget by 1887
  - introduces new taxes on alcohol, soy sauce, etc to pay for this
- Political consequences
  - leads to series of incidents
  - Fukushima Incident in 1882
    - governor was a man from Satsuma (outsider) and had the goal to build a new highway with the
      labor of the local population
    - locals dont like this, and lead to public protests, lead by the Liberal Party
    - governor responds with strong arm tactics, taking land, arresting liberal party leaders, etc
    - people respond by attacking the local police headquarters
  - Kaba-san Incident in 1884
    - liberal party members plan to assassinate the governor
    - plan is discovered and the leaders are executed, imprisoned
  - Gunma Incident in 1884
    - liberal party members tried to assassinate another group of leaders at a railway line opening
    - people involved in the attack are rounded up
  - seeing the lack of control over the party, Itagaki decides to disband the party
  - Chiichibu Incident in 1884
    - area where people are very badly affected by deflation
    - form various political parties and present demands, asking for relief from the government
    - At the end of 1884, the government sends army to supress the locals from seizing the
      town/their march to Tokyo, crushing the protests and sending many to prison/~10 to death
- Significance for the Movement for Freedom and Popular Rights
  - Matsukata's determination to ignore the people did pave the way for Japan's first industrial
    revolution in the 1890s
  - village leaders started to question their support of the movement

## References

Kusonose Kita’s Letter to the Authorities, 1878

“We women who are heads of households must respond to the demands of the government just as other
ordinary heads of households, but because we are women, we do not enjoy equal rights. We have the
right neither to vote for district assembly representative nor to act as legal guarantors in matters
of property, even though we hold legal instruments for that purpose. This is an enormous
infringement of our rights...!

“If it is reasonable to assume that rights and duties go together, then we should make that widely
held assumption that they are in fact corresponding responsibilities a reality... I do not have the
right to vote. I do not have the right to act as guarantor. My rights, compared with those of male
heads of households, are totally ignored. Most reprehensible of all, the only equality I share with
men who are heads of their households is the onerous duty of paying taxes...

“Officials to whom I complained tell me that men have greater rights than women because they bear
the additional burden of military service... but my protest stands, since it is well known that men
are routinely excused from military service precisely because they are heads of their households!”
