feminist/women's activist
vision of women + men:

- men were partying and not doing anything; being disappointer turned down first marriage proposal
  motherly figure role to the movement

- beggar woman:
  - gave her a 50 sen note (pg 38)
  - significant for her, but meant the world to the beggar woman digging through the trash with her
    child on her shoulders
  - ran into her in prison; put in the same prison cell
  - but by now, the woman's child + husband had died
  - "hardships of life led this weak woman to prefer the pains of prison to freedom and life. Who
    can deny that this is a miserable state of affairs?"
- spent time with women that society labeled major criminals; acted as their mother + at times as
  their friend (page 40)
  - their feelings of respesct and love for me were much stronger than the sentiments that bind
    teachers and students in the outside world. Even among one's own family, the sense of unity foregd
    by the common sentiments and emotions that prevailed in the little world that we inhabited is
    seldom found"
- was cold to Kobayashi (husband) but received a love letter from Oi (pg 45).
