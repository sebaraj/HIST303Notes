## Three Big Ideas

### What is Japan?

- Product of complex chain of historical events and struggles
- Thought of as continually evolving historical creation
- Map of Japan in 1800:
  - Hokkaido (northern most of Japan's 4 islands today)
    - Was kind of and kind of not considered a part of Japan in 1800
    - In Japan at the time, was called "Ezo" which means northern barbarians
    - How did the native Inu people being "Japanese"
  - Okinawa (Ryukyu Kingdom) was also not really considered Japan at the time
    - Had its own culture
- Japan's borders in 1910 were also profoundly different (much more expansive, with parts of modern
  day Korea, Russia, Hong Kong, etc)
- Geographical inner-core of Japan has remained stable, but the meaning of "Japan" to those people
  has changed over time
- Japan is now a unitary state, but in 1800 it was divided into a hodgepodge of feudal baronies,
  thought of as their own small countries in their own right
  - Baronies were not completely autonomous. Starting in 16th century, they were forged into
    federations of states
  - At the beginning of the 17th century, Tokugawa Ieyasu founded the Tokugawa Bakafu, which was a
    warrior government, headed by a great general (shogun). histories also use the term, shogunate.
  - 15 Tokugawa shoguns. Functioned as central authority
- Important was the arrival in 1850s of Commodore Perry send by President Filmore to "open Japan"
  and create friendly relations
- In a few years, Townsend Harris (the first American consul to Japan) arrived to take residence in
  Japan
- Imperialism emerges as a major theme. First, western imperialism and its impact on Japan, and then
  Japanese imperialism and its impact on other parts of Asia
- Japan's Modern Revolution - refers to the dramatic changes that swept through Japanese society.
- Not just modern, but also a modernizing revolution. Japan's leaders very consciously set out to
  establish a modern state.
- Also a puzzling paradox: Meiji Restoration in 1868
  - Leaders claimed they were going to take Japan back 1000 years back before the rise of the
    warrior governments, when the Tenno (emperor) ruled and linked the people back to their gods
  - Perhaps the restoration actually contributed to the modern revolution's success
