## Lecture Outline

### Religion and the State: Buddhism, Shinto and Christianity

#### 1. Religion and the State in the Tokugawa Period

- in decade following Meiji Restoration, Buddhism came very close to disappearing
- imperial prediction eradication of Buddhism within 5-7 years
- Buddhist priests were displaced and thousands of temples/items were destroyed/sold off
- how do we explain this (religious destruction):
  - going back to late Tokugawa
  - require everyone to register as a parishioner of a temple, recording the affiliation of everyone
    in great detail (see late 17th century example: shumon aratame-cho)
    - cozy relationship that Buddhism gets with the Bakufu is associated with clerical
      laxity/spiritual teachings. buddhist priests start to often be represented by being driven by
      earthly desires, not spiritual ones, and have a major image problem.

#### 2. Anti-Buddhist Sentiment and Kokugaku

- idea that Kami had been relegated to a secondary position, was
  - honji suijaku = kami are wordly manefestations of buddhas
  - tori gate (very traditional, Kami element) in buddhist temple
  - get a mixing together of the two currents of belief
  - as early of the 17th century, some domains attempted to intervene and promote the worship of the
    Kami in a new way
  - Mito orders abolishment of half of all Buddhist temples in his domain, forcing the priests to
    become shrine priests at Kami centers (17th century)
  - Tsuwano domain, 18th century, Ōkuni Takamasa, Fukuba Bisei, and others, promote the worship of
    Kami in a new way
    - two important advisors were Okuni Takamasa and his main disciple, Fukuba Bisei
    - set it motion a harsh purge of Buddhism in the domain
    - Buddhist institution was seen as a parasite on the domain and on the people, bleeding them and
      impoverishing them through their donations.
    - samurai were banned using buddhist burial rites
- connect reading > one of the things that's fueling her is the desire for a connection with the
  native gods (through the emperor)
- jingikan: shrine restoration movement/department of divinity/council of gods
  - launches a nation-wide policy of seperating Kami from Buddhas
  - in practice, involved removing all shinto objects from Buddhist temples and establishing shrines
    that were completely independent of the Buddhist temples
    - a "purification" movement
  - but there were unauthorized plundering of Buddhist temples, bringing institutional Buddhism in
    japan to its brink
  - late tokugawa period: japan has 400,000 temples; but by 1876, that fell to 71,000 temples
  - number of buddhist priests fell from 65,000 to 25,000

#### 3. The Restoration, “State Shinto” and the Persecution of Buddhism

- whole team of evangelists, who were going around the country, preaching the new religion (shinto
  priests, entertainers, etc.)

#### 4. Christianity, the West and the Buddhist Revival

- Christianity was seen as a threat to the state, and was persecuted
- but western powers made it abundantly clear that they would not tolerate the persecution of
  Christians (freedom of religion = freedom to spread Christianity)
- Iwakura Tomomi takes lead to renegotiate treaties with western powers, who make it clear that
  nothing will change until the ban on Christianity is lifted
  - he ultimately argues that the ban of Chrisitianity be lifted
- council of gods is relagated to a minor role after this seen failure.
- buddhist leaders start to regroup, and begin to develop own strategies to defend themselves from
  the critiques that were central to their persecution in earlier years
  - present themselves as critically important to the state and the people
  - organizze greater cooperation between the different sects of buddhism
  - western missionaries (protestant christianity) were having an easy time converting samurai, who used the conversion as a
    way to learn about a whole new system of knowledge (but important to note the number of converts
    were still small ~30,000, but were significantly more/rapid success when compared to China)
  - idea to be Japanese and Christian was seen as having divided loyalties, so buddhists were at a
    distinct advantage
  - buddhism was a channel to draw on the learning and understanding on the entire world, not just
    from the west, but also from the east
    - was able to take the best from everything, seen as the best balance of what the western and
      eastern worlds had to offer

“At the present, provincial temples are being destroyed; people are withdrawing their memberships and this causes temple revenues to decline; priests are gladly returning to secular life. Although there is no demand to destroy Buddhism there probably has been nothing to compare with this situation in the fourteen or fifteen centuries during which Buddhism has been in Japan. In my opinion there will be an Imperial Rescript eradicating Buddhism within five to seven years.”

– Pure Land Buddhist priest, Fukuda Gyōkai in early 1870s.
